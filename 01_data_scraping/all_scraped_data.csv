0,100slw5_00001,I subscribe to Task Master SuperMaxPlus and only see New Year Treat I there. Any reason why II and III are not listed?
1,100slw5_00002,Why wasn’t Greg James cast for a full series? He seems to fit what Alex says he looks for for a full series. He’s a comedian (tick) and radio personality like past contestants (Alive Levine).
2,100slw5_00003,"I've had enough. They can't keep doing this to us! Simply appalling to introduce all these lovely and hilarious people, and then take them away after just 45 minutes."
3,100slw5_00004,"Sir Mo was a delight!!! Now we need an all ""hilariously good sports in every situation"" Taskmaster! Sir Mo - Mel Giedroyc - Wozniak - Chris Ramsey ---- who else ????"
4,100slw5_00005,I...did not expect to come out of that episode absolutely besotted with Mo Farah. But I did.
5,100slw5_00006,"Follow my logic here. Normal taskmaster is full series length. Champion of Champions for normal taskmaster is just a special, 1-2 episodes. New Years Treat taskmaster is special length, so therefore Champion of New Years Treat Champions should be full series length. Makes sense right? I need more of both Mo Farah and Adrian Chiles doing tasks."
6,100slw5_00007,"Just occurred to me it's a shame they'd already used ""Hello"" as an episode title"
7,100slw5_00008,But what you can't take away from Mo is he had an absolutely lovely day.
8,100slw5_00009,Greg accidentally writing his own name on the card LMAO
9,100slw5_00010,"""If I hit you enough you might tell me where the bucket is."" ""The bucket's behind you."""
10,100slw5_00011,"They said the Olympics/World Championships/Taskmaster treble could never be achieved, but..."
11,100slw5_00012,Mo Farah really surprised me. I didn't think he'd enter into the childlike surrealism of the show. He was amazing.
12,100slw5_00013,"I wonder if they brought in Josh to count those pellets and just told him it was for the ""Champion of Champions of Champions"" task."
13,100slw5_00014,"A HAIRDRYER, I HOWLED"
14,100slw5_00015,"“It’s Taskmaster, it’s not supposed to be fun”"
15,100slw5_00016,I hope to one day be as happy as Mo was after having that head massager used on him
16,100slw5_00017,"Across 14 series, and 5 specials, that ending celebration Mo does is the most exuberant and joyful any contestant has done"
17,100slw5_00018,I can’t believe only one person answered the phone and STILL got it wrong
18,100slw5_00019,
19,100slw5_00020,"I enjoyed that one. Mo had major ""What you can't take away from me is that I had an absolutely lovely day"" energy and still won. Olympic champion and Taskmaster champion!"
20,100slw5_00021,well Sir Mo Farah seems to be the greatest human
21,100slw5_00022,This has not disproved the theory that Sir Mo Farah is good at everything
22,100slw5_00023,I guess we shouldn’t have been surprised that Mo ran away with it.
23,100slw5_00024,Was worried Mo would've been like your standard media trained team GB Olympian but the man is having the time of his life
24,100slw5_00025,I'll never get the image of Carol Voderman completely stiff and sliding down a wall out of my head
25,100slw5_00026,WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING - these tasks are especially mad
26,100slw5_00027,"""Words are more powerful than imag...es?"""
27,100slw5_00028,"""HELLO?! WOOOOOOOOO!"" Mo Farah, Olympian Athlete"
28,100slw5_00029,So when Greg predicted one of the contestants would do so badly they'd lose their home... And Carol brought in essentially her home for 3-4 months of the year...
29,100slw5_00030,This episode was too short! I’m sure I said this last year but if they’re doing one-offs they should be at least 90 minutes.
30,100slw5_00031,"Amelia saying ""I'm shouting."" at normal speaking volume lmao"
31,100slw5_00032,"Fantastic episode, and I'm inordinately delighted by Carol declaring ""I think I did do well"" in the counting task, and then genuinely doing well. Especially just a couple minutes after talking about pooing in her van. Neither of those should happen all the time, but they're lovely one-off moments."
32,100slw5_00033,Rebecca definitely yelled out 'Fuck you Greg James' not Davies!
33,100slw5_00034,"Nothing like Taskmaster to make me go ""wow"" at something which, if written down, is the most mundane thing imaginable"
34,100slw5_00035,Mo Farah sign!!!!
35,100slw5_00036,"I'm so impressed that the NYE Treat managed to improve on the live task from NZ series 3. The objects rhymed and they added the Simon Says element to it. On top of that, I loved Rebecca's absolutely triumphant Carp Pellets performance, even though she didn't win. I also loved her enthusiasm for everyone, particularly the night's ultimate winner... Mo Farah! Holy shit, so cool! Weirdly, I looked up Mo because of Big Narstie on Big Fat Quiz (""Mo Farah sign!"" Jimmy: ""THAT IS NOT THE MO FARAH SIGN!"") and learned of his athletic career from that rabbit hole. He was an absolute joy in this special. Congrats to him!"
36,100slw5_00037,"Amelia Dimoldenberg is having a nervous breakdown after a mere 11 minutes of the show, well done team, you have crushed her fragile spirit."
37,100slw5_00038,Can’t believe the first contestant to floor me in the episode is Mo and his hairdryer
38,100slw5_00039,"Absolutely love Self Esteem, she seems like a normal person who's won a competition to be on all her favourite TV shows and she's having the best time. Also incredible song writer, singer and stage performer, her last album was perfect."
39,100slw5_00040,"Amelia didn't even have the tripwire, actually got some of the caravan pellets and still had far less than everyone else so far (expecting Rebecca's to be a disaster)"
40,100slw5_00041,"Wasn’t familiar with Rebecca prior to this but was definitely an enjoyable contestant to watch. Really thought there would be more studio comments for the “fuck you Greg James” bit there. Also haven’t seen Mo’s on screen work, but that was definitely not what I was expecting."
41,100slw5_00042,I'm feeling that whoever answers the phone gets the answer given to them.
42,100slw5_00043,"These New Years Treats are so much fun, but they end way too quickly. I don't know how they always land these perfect casts. I only knew of Carol Vorderman, but they all did great. My first good laugh of 2023 comes at the expense of Greg James walking like a stiff-limbed Frankenstein's monster with a fish bowl in his hands. I feel like he's the only one who truly committed to the no-bending clause; I noticed quite a few infractions, especially with Mo. Although Amelia looked incredible in her jumpsuit. Rebecca's attempt oddly made me proud. I loved her random ""Fuck you, Greg James!"" A little disappointing that they repeated a studio task with ""Greg Says,"" but overall it was an enjoyable episode. I really need to invest in one of those scalp massagers now."
43,100slw5_00044,Winning Taskmaster > Olympic medals
44,100slw5_00045,"in a regular series there would have been disqualifications all over the place (most people bending, Greg turning the picture) but I think it's for the better to be more forgiving in the NYT"
45,100slw5_00046,Mentally scarred by how Greg pronounces “says”.
46,100slw5_00047,God knows what's going on here - https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm46WOCJ4lu/
47,100slw5_00048,"What was the line? Something like, ""Taskmaster is much more erotic than I thought"" and then Alex said ""we get that all the time?"" Amazing."
48,100slw5_00049,I wonder if he'll hang his four Olympic gold medals from the trophy.
49,100slw5_00050,"Sir Mo Farah I knew very little about coming to this special, but he ended up being my favourite NYT 2023 contestant by far! Man was just loving every second of it!"
50,100slw5_00051,Best NYT ever. First time I thought a whole lineup really gelled well and I would love to have in a full series.
51,100slw5_00052,I think the NYT episodes(and CoC if not 2) should be a longer like Big Fat Quiz length I NEED MORE!!!!!
52,100slw5_00053,HELLO! WOOOO!
53,100slw5_00054,"""Yours had a knob on the side of the house"""
54,100slw5_00055,Mo and Greg buddy cop show please.
55,100slw5_00056,"Is that how Greg normally says ""says""?"
56,100slw5_00057,"If they ever do expand these to 90 minutes or to two episodes, I'd love to see them throw in a team task. I also love that on these one off episodes, the contestants really try with the prize tasks. They know they only get one shot at the show, and they go for it. Thinking of people that were on this episode or mentioned, or have some other connection to them, I'd love to see Rachel Riley, Jimmy Carr, and Big Narstie for one of these, if not on a regular series. They could even get Chris Eubank for the next NYT as the athlete contestant, and Greg can do his impression of him again."
57,100slw5_00058,Sliding under the tripwire and pulling the fan directly into the fishbowl is immediately an all timer Taskmaster pulling something off moment
58,100slw5_00059,"Yes! Mo deserved to win, frankly. But more importantly Greg was right and Carol lost her home!"
59,100slw5_00060,"Well, thanks to this episode I now have a fetish for blond women in jumpsuits who are unable to bend at their waist and knees. Did Carol actually submit a working vehicle for a prize task? I was surprised that Amelia did so poorly for the carp pellet task. Did she miss a bucket? Rebecca's pulling the bucket off the pedestal into her fish bowl and her Mission Impossible crawl was amazing. Great show. I wonder if they'd try to do a New Year's Treat Champion of Champions eventually."
60,100slw5_00061,"""Well it wouldn't be spotty if you remembered to put my cream on"""
61,100slw5_00062,
62,100slw5_00063,Greg standing next to sir Mo Farah was incredible TV!
63,100slw5_00064,Really love it when there are five generous people whose studio interactions feel like an ensemble while their behavior in the tasks is off-the-charts wild
64,100slw5_00065,"Who would have thought three hot blondes, an Olympian, and two dudes named Greg would make for such a fun hour of television"
65,100slw5_00066,"Wow, all these tasks have been super stressful!"
66,100slw5_00067,Mo gently feeding the blackbird vs. Carol shoving seeds in and asking for another orifice 😂
67,100slw5_00068,May we all experience as much joy throughout this new year as Mo does from a head massage
68,100slw5_00069,HAIRDRYER I'M WHEEZING
69,100slw5_00070,"For it is written: whenever there is a shorter taskmaster one off ep, so it shall be that the fans want more of it. Even though the only reason taskmaster can get these stars is because of the shorter time commitment. But I get why, it's always so much fun!"
70,100slw5_00071,I honestly might be in love with Amelia. Gutted we don’t get her for a full series.
71,100slw5_00072,He can't bend the legs or waist but Greg does know he can bend his arms right? Apparently not.
72,100slw5_00073,"Can we hear Greg call Carol, “Vorders” forever? Thank you."
73,100slw5_00074,"That was an amazing bunch - I’d happily take all 5 of them for a full series! Love how they all started yelling at Greg (D) during the live task. It’s Taskmaster, it’s not supposed to be fun! They fit well into different Taskmaster archetypes! Amelia - the nervous energy with hilarious non sequiturs Carol - the smart one / not afraid to abuse Alex Greg - competitive Mo - just having a lovely day Rebecca - the other competitive one!"
74,100slw5_00075,But did Mo Farah keep Carol's van??
75,100slw5_00076,"Huge fan of Amelia, but I am not sure the format was right for her to shine. But I know she would be brilliant in a full series as the banter would have time to build."
76,100slw5_00077,I wonder if Carol has figured out she might lose her camper yet.
77,100slw5_00078,Self Esteem with “clever little lady” etched onto her back whilst unable to stand up. Excellent
78,100slw5_00079,This is the most accidentally genius thing I have seen this year
79,100slw5_00080,What a fantastic episode Mo Farah was easily my favorite contestant of this bunch
80,100slw5_00081,Loved all of them but Rebecca would be absolutely hilarious on a full series I think. My favourite New Year's episode for sure.
81,100slw5_00082,"I'm American, so maybe I'm one of the few fans who didn't know Sir Mo Farah is a victim of child trafficking."
82,100slw5_00083,The cushions have numbers on them!
83,100slw5_00084,Omg Moe with tears in his eyes!
84,100slw5_00085,
85,100slw5_00086,The last six months has done a huge amount for my opinion of Mo Farah - I was fairly indifferent about him previously but the documentary about him last summer and Taskmaster have made me a huge fan
86,100slw5_00087,"I must say, Amelia's rocking that Air France dress."
87,100slw5_00088,Mo's prize task and Rebecca's Mission Impossible stunt had me laughing so hard!
88,100slw5_00089,"The prize task for this special was such an actual TREAT! The banter was so good between Greg and Alex and the 5 contestants. Such a pity that we only had Greg James for an episode because going by that instance where Greg wrote ""Davies"" instead of ""James"" on his cards, he would've fluffed up one or 2 more with a 10-episode run. Just brilliant and had a lot of funny and iconic moments!"
89,100slw5_00090,"If they wear fake mustaches, do you think this crew could come back for a full season? Because I am loving this group!"
90,100slw5_00091,"""Liberal pussies who don't know how to party"" 😂😂😂😂"
91,100slw5_00092,Can we get Rebecca on the main show? Need a series of her antics!
92,100slw5_00093,"That was excellent television. I think the New Year Specials invoke the same kind of feeling that I used to get watching Saturday Night TV in the 90's (when it was good). Also, not sure if anyone asked this, but do you think they'll do an NYT CoC? Shirley Ballas / Adrian Chiles / Mo Farrah sounds like a chirpy episode."
93,100slw5_00094,"Mo would've been great on a full series, not just performance wise but by how much fun he was having. I feel like they had some lenience on the carp-feed task because it was a just a one-off... no one got DQ'd for bending. I was just waiting for the ""let's see the VT again,"" because I'm pretty sure that at least one person bent their knee whilst stepping over the tripwire. Some brilliant tasks, they really do go full hog for a one-off with tasks of difficulty & complexity that could just as well be main series ones."
94,100slw5_00095,Rebecca is a fucking genius holy shit
95,100slw5_00096,No wonder Rebecca has so much Self Esteem.
96,100slw5_00097,RLT is my absolute favourite
97,100slw5_00098,"I'm genuinely wondering how Greg Davies has managed to get through his entire life thinking that ""says"" is pronounced like that. It's a common word! Has no one ever corrected him?"
98,100slw5_00099,"Fucking hell, Mo - that was superb"
99,100slw5_00100,
100,100slw5_00101,I’m guessing if they answer the phone it will tell them the correct number of dots (and that Greg will do exactly that) Edit: nailed it!
101,100slw5_00102,Mo being happy makes me happy
102,100slw5_00103,This is reminding me of “without moving the fishbowl” 🤣
103,100slw5_00104,Mo has the walk of someone who has had a dodgy curry and needs to reach a toilet ASAP
104,100slw5_00105,Loved both Mo and Rebecca!
105,100slw5_00106,"That was a great episode! Every task a winner, every contestant a gem. I had to hold my belly Daisy-May-style when Sir Mo busted out ""my hairdryer."" Great stuff."
106,100slw5_00107,"Alex should have designed the carp pellet task so that contestants incurred a penalty (ie they had 100 carp pellets deducted from their final score or something) every time they bent their knees or waist. Not being specific about that meant that the rule couldn't actually be enforced properly, because doing so would have disqualified pretty much everyone, which wouldn't have made for good television as it would have seemed too pedantic. RLT in particular had an extremely obvious knee bend that was just ignored as if the bending thing wasn't part of that rules. The Mission Impossible stunts she pulled to get the pellets in the bowl were so good that would have seemed buzzkill-y to rain on the parade of that performance by disqualifying her (as she technically should have been). Not necessarily saying that Greg made the wrong call to decide not to enforce the rule, but I do think that getting into situations where he has to basically decide to ignore a supposed rule for the sake of making the show work better speaks to poor wording in the task design."
107,100slw5_00108,"Mo Farah is one of the best contestants ever. I don't think there's ever been a contestant who had so much joy just for being there. Also, Carol Vorderman , Mo Farah, and Rebecca all seemed like they would be amazing in a full 10 episode series."
108,100slw5_00109,Wasn’t familiar with Rebecca beforehand and now I’m a little bit in love with her
109,100slw5_00110,Unpopular Opinion: Greg says “say-z” instead of “sezz” and it bothered me the whole live task 🙈
110,100slw5_00111,"On the rewatch I notice that in his intro Greg says that one person will do so badly that it will lead directly and ultimately to the loss of their home. Then Carol loses her home of 3-4 months of the year. Great prediction, Greg! Unless they did the intro after the taping of the live task which wouldn't make any sense other than to allow Greg to predict a loser..."
111,100slw5_00112,FUCK YOU GREG JAMES
112,100slw5_00113,I just wish Amelia specifically was on a full series! Love self esteem too but know she's touring like mad so prob not doable but wish AD was on a full one! She's so great
113,100slw5_00114,That last task is the perfect party game!
114,100slw5_00115,"That was fantastic! Normally, I only enjoy the NYT as an extra opportunity to see TM, but that was incredible in its own right. Such a good cast. I wish there was more!"
115,100slw5_00116,Someone should answer the phone.
116,100slw5_00117,oh this live task was CHAOS on NZ i love it
117,100slw5_00118,Sir Mo is the sweetest ❤️
118,100slw5_00119,Mo was so much more wholesome than I expected. Delighted that he won.
119,100slw5_00120,"I really loved this NYT this year. Go Sir Mo Farah, that slide at the end was the best win!"
120,100slw5_00121,"Absolutely loved Amelia and Sir Mo Farah, both them are so adorable, especially Amelia, who is the definition of ""adorkable"" Was really surprised Sir Mo won the Cod challenge though, I was under the impression all the girls did way better than the boys"
121,100slw5_00122,Best NYT yet in my opinion! That’s not an insult to the previous two just this years was so so good!
122,100slw5_00123,
123,100slw5_00124,Amelia is literally a bucket list contestant for me. Shame it's only a special!
124,100slw5_00125,Anyone ordered a head massager straight away or just me?
125,100slw5_00126,"That was so much fun, everyone seemed to have a blast. Especially Self Esteem."
126,100slw5_00127,"Anyone else listened to the podcast after and disagree with Ed's accusation of Mo's bend of knee? I didnt count but pretty sure everyone bent it at some point. The person who he was talking to, famously bent it right at the beginning of the task! I think they realize it that the way they phrase it is quite humanly impossible, so they just let it go as long as the spirit of the task was met. Or they fully prepare for someone to go nut but have the VT on whoever ready."
127,100slw5_00128,I had no idea Sir Mo was so tiny!
128,100slw5_00129,Mo got so much pleasure out of that head massage.
129,100slw5_00130,I'm gutted this cast isn't a full season line up 😫
130,100slw5_00131,"Tie break for second, third, fourth, fifth please!"
131,100slw5_00132,"That might have been one of the most bonkers episodes yet, and I loved all of it."
132,100slw5_00133,"I was pleasantly surprised by Mo. The last time he was on my radar was when it came out that he was a suspected drugs cheat (and gave inconsistent accounts to different authorities) so I started the episode thinking I wouldn’t like him but he was adorable. I found Amelia a bit grating but I think that’s her persona, having seen a couple of the chicken shop dates or whatever they are called. Carol was great and Rebecca was a revelation. Never heard of her but she was brilliant. I found Greg James a little underwhelming but I think my expectations may have been too high. I think he’s thrive in a full series."
133,100slw5_00134,So…Mo Farrah is an absolute treasure.
134,100slw5_00135,Also that was an excellent live task!
135,100slw5_00136,HELLO!!
136,100slw5_00137,"I'd like to know when someone is going to turn Farrahs ""HELLO...WOOO"" into a message alert tone that I can use 😁"
137,100slw5_00138,First fresh ad of the year.
138,100slw5_00139,I've never seen Chicken Shop Date but I like Amelia immediately from the fly coffin
139,100slw5_00140,Mo is having the time of his life.
140,100slw5_00141,Full series with this cast or riot
141,100slw5_00142,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it! Given there weren’t any well-known comedians in the line up, and there were several I didn’t know at all, I thought the enthusiasm was palpable and the tasks were great. Half the fun is noticing minor rule infractions and wondering if they’ll be called out, and disagreeing with subjective TM decisions, but it had the spirit of a series crammed into one show 😃"
142,100slw5_00143,Sir Mo is a nutcase! Didn't have that one on my bingo card! What an absolute happy bunny :D
143,100slw5_00144,"Greg James' prize of the Virgin Jonathan Ross and the Christ Child Moyles is a stupendously horrible item, well done Greg."
144,100slw5_00145,"""Really Likeable Tart"" 😂"
145,100slw5_00146,Part 2: eat the carp pellets you collect
146,100slw5_00147,"Greg James is clearly teetering on the verge of sanity throughout this, bless him."
147,100slw5_00148,"Great ep! Also, those were stressful tasks! Very impressed by everyone's performance (except that I'm shocked more people didn't answer the phone for the dot counting.... only bc that task was so crazy, I would've been looking for any out)"
148,100slw5_00149,These tasks are absolutely unhinged
149,100slw5_00150,Well we need another episode to truly settle silver in that case
150,100slw5_00151,"The new years specials are usually pretty ""meh"", but this one I thoroughly enjoyed. Each contestant was Great"
151,100slw5_00152,"I will now prey every day for a for a New Years Champions mini-series, just to watch Sir Farah have a lovely time doing silly things."
152,100slw5_00153,"Well, I'm a little bit in love with Mo Farah now."
153,100slw5_00154,"“Ah, fuck!” added to my list of episode titles that never were"
154,100slw5_00155,Watched last night finally and thought it was absolutely fantastic! I had a two week old asleep on me and had to hand him over to my husband because I was laughing too much. Excellent tasks!
155,100slw5_00156,No way Greg only deserved 1 point - that was mental. Think this should have been a 'nobody gets 1 point' round
156,100slw5_00157,Pretty sure Rebecca had the binoculars the wrong way round and that makes me like her more than I already did
157,100slw5_00158,Rebecca and Mo becoming besties is not something I expected or something I thought I needed
158,100slw5_00159,That was great fun! My love for Greg James just grew
159,100slw5_00160,"Man, I always wish we'd get a full series with the New Year shows. The contestants are always so great. This was amazing"
160,100slw5_00161,"I probably didn't enjoy it as much as last year's which is pushing my favourite ever ep, but it was still Really great, wish it was 90 mins."
161,100slw5_00162,My fav NYT yet
162,100slw5_00163,Such a good ep. Only knew Mo and Carol. But damn they were all good. Rebecca super adorable
163,100slw5_00164,"I really thought someone was going to refuse to play the final task because the first instruction didn't start with ""Greg Says"" while the second one did."
164,100slw5_00165,"I liked that the contestants actually put effort in to the prize task and bought in interesting items. I didn't like the first task, which was one of those ones that lacks any real opportunity for different approaches and then went on too long."
165,100slw5_00166,RLT is living entirely up to expectations.
166,100slw5_00167,"i adore amelia! i think she would be great for a full season, i’ve loved her comedy stuff for a while now! she was very lovely to watch! and well done to mr sir mo! well deserved"
167,100slw5_00168,Carol's comment on Rebecca's post... (eyes emoji) https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm43l8yjMcr/ Which in turn led me to this: https://www.instagram.com/vordervan/
168,100slw5_00169,"Y’all, I am so relieved Carol wasn’t disqualified for flipping the paper"
169,100slw5_00170,
170,100slw5_00171,"It's kind of awkward for Amelia because she plays a character in all her videos, must be awkward trying to balance that public persona with being a bit more genuine for the show"

1,113ldl3_00002,"Does anyone else feel Nina is being underscored and Luke is being overscored? I'm Canadian - don't know any of the personalities on the show, but I think this is an excellent cast. I am liking both Toms, and I think Tom Gleeson is a great Taskmaster - but through three episodes I feel like his scoring is all over the place, with Luke/Nina especially."
2,113ldl3_00003,"Main Tom still seems a bit torn between facing the contestants and facing the camera. Lesser Tom is doing a great job, though."
3,113ldl3_00004,Tom's doing really well as TM. Great choice
4,113ldl3_00005,Does anyone else see all the contestants as grayed out when they're in the studio? I remember that being an issue with a few episodes of Taskmaster. Is it a YouTube compression thing or is it something else?
5,113ldl3_00006,"Watching this from a non-cricket country, I had minimal knowledge of the sport and no idea what a cricket appeal is. I was expecting at least one person to make an appeal while sounding like a cricket."
6,113ldl3_00007,"Dangit. I watched ep 1 and 2, but now it says I am running an ad blocker (which to be fair, I was all along), but I even tried turning it off and it still says I am running one."
7,113ldl3_00008,Tom you piece of shit give me the five points
8,113ldl3_00009,The fact that nobody seems to know the rules of cricket has made this task much better than it otherwise would have been
9,113ldl3_00010,"There are two wolves inside you. One is Luke McGregor hesitantly calling Greater Tom a piece of shit, the other is James Acaster calling Greg a pussy unprompted."
10,113ldl3_00011,How many times has the moon had an aneurysm? ✨
11,113ldl3_00012,"I love Tom's directness. ""it's clear that was shit"" the sort of vibe that you want in a good taskmaster."
12,113ldl3_00013,"What a live task, this is so fucking good."
13,113ldl3_00014,The triplets are going to be so chaotic. Nina and Jimmy are going to go off the rails and Luke lacks the authority to tell them no. Also I would be very surprised if that live task didn't show up in Series 16.
14,113ldl3_00015,Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d hear Luke call Tom a piece of shit
15,113ldl3_00016,"After losing the live task, it looks like Julia has to go through with her promise of... driving her car?"
16,113ldl3_00017,That triplets task was a complete trainwreck and I loved it!
17,113ldl3_00018,"Oh, Nina, Jimmy and Luke is a killer combo."
18,113ldl3_00019,I love Julia Morris just embracing the Jo Brand route of using the least effort possible.
19,113ldl3_00020,I don't think anyone had Luke calling the Taskmaster a piece of shit on their bingo cards.
20,113ldl3_00021,I have no idea what is going on in this cricket round.
21,113ldl3_00022,"""There was no giraffe."""
22,113ldl3_00023,"> ""I'll mark it on passion"" > Luke scores higher than Nina Pure Taskmaster. I hate the decision but you love to see it."
23,113ldl3_00024,Congratulations to Luke Macgregor on his recent marriage ♥
24,113ldl3_00025,Kinda wondering how many non-Australians out there are going be confused about our usage of the word thong for a piece of footwear.
25,113ldl3_00026,I think this is the first time that a whole team was given a sneaky task.
26,113ldl3_00027,I prefer Nina's version of cricket.
27,113ldl3_00028,That's a great live task
28,113ldl3_00029,the live task was my fave task of the episode
29,113ldl3_00030,"So, I made some predictions when the cast was first announced, and 3 episodes in, here are my updates! Tom Gleeson's pre-existing persona fits well with a harsh Taskmaster, as expected. I almost worry he's being too harsh at times, which will keep contrasting nicely with a pretty positive set of contestants this season, but might make future contestants nervous to try creative/fun interpretations on tasks! Nina is great, so glad she'll get a bigger profile from this! Strong neurotic millennial vibes and I am here for it. (Also, hi if you're reading this Nina!!) Glad I was right to vouch for Julia! She's best known for reality shows, but cut her teeth in stand-up and actually spent 7 years based in the UK, so maybe that UK comedy panel experience prepared her for the structure of Taskmaster? Jo Brand vibes as u/EbmocwenHsimah suggested, but I'm also getting Liza Tarbuck beloved-aunty vibes. She's a bit old for all this nonsense, but when a bit is funny, she commits! Luke has actually been doing a hilariously adorable job at subverting the nervous-wreck expectations! Case in point: the live-task-winning ""Tom you piece of shit give me five points"". The way the last syllables of his sentences end on such a high pitch is low-key endearing though. Not far off predicting Jimmy as a less competitive Iain Stirling. I see u/eka8897's Richard Osman comparison too - he stands out a bit at first, but he has so much fun that he fits right in. His online sketch comedy chops definitely come in handy too, e.g. the cricket task this episode and the minute-long montage in the first episode. Is Danielle a rural Aussie version of Harriet Kemsley or what? Called it. I think Tom Cashman's less subservient take on Taskmaster's Assistant helps him play the occasionally-kooky straight man to Gleeson's harsher TM. Maybe it's just because they use the same TM house, but he comes across as more of an infantile Paul Williams type than a servile Alex Horne type."
30,113ldl3_00031,"""Couldn't... think... in... triplet form."""
31,113ldl3_00032,"Was anyone else prepared for the Eggs 3's second question to be ""What is your quest""?"
32,113ldl3_00033,For those unfamiliar with Tom's past cricketing history. https://youtu.be/hG6llE2q2sY
33,113ldl3_00034,I have no idea what just happened with Jimmy's but I think it was cathartic for him. And it was funny as hell.
34,113ldl3_00035,"On the live task, I think it would have been (more) interesting if the paddles were, in WILTY style, not seen until they picked them."
35,113ldl3_00036,
36,113ldl3_00037,Finally a team task! Jimmy was vaguely sinister appearing from behind the wall like that.
37,113ldl3_00038,Nina not getting the 5 points for her worms is the first great robbery of TM Australia
38,113ldl3_00039,"“I’m getting improv troop vibes from one of the teams and I’m having none of it” got a big laugh from me. I think the studio editing was less shit this week but far from perfect. Still just waiting for the banter of the Toms to get better, also wish Tom G was just more mean. Really enjoying the Season though"
39,113ldl3_00040,"Good episode especially the final task, Nina’s “pappreciate” did get a laugh out of me but Julia and Luke were clearly the best. Every week I love Julia more and more, she’s so funny. Her cricket appeal was my favourite and much like Nina and Danielle and much of the world, I’m still unsure what a cricket appeal is. The thong task was firmly middling until Julia took off with it. The team task was pretty great, love to see the awkward interactions when the teams first meet. Would also like to comment on how nice Nina’s outfits are, she always looks incredible. Loved her outfit this episode. I desperately want the whole fit."
40,113ldl3_00041,"Sadly a disappointing prize task. I really wish more versions would do as Norway does and have the contestant physical reveal their entry. It seems to contribute to cutting down on low effort entries, especially 'conceptual gags' that aren't even prizes. Like that Tom didn't like the cgi on what should be a physical task. There's a time and a place for digital effects and too much reliance on post-production goes against the spirit of the show."
41,113ldl3_00042,"""Looking forward to seeing our one?"" ""Yeah, I think your one's going to be amazing"" ""Oh, there's no one for the other team"" ""... what?"""
42,113ldl3_00043,"""howzat?"""
43,113ldl3_00044,"Never been big on Julia Morris, ever since fast forward days. But she's been great in taskmaster!"
44,113ldl3_00045,"""I would have won, and also died"" deserved a much bigger laugh. Who the heck is editing this? You were robbed Nina. Hi, by the way. ""Twins are born minutes apart, not decades"" was a nice slam Greater Tom. I think those comparing Tom unfavourably to Greg could go back and watch Season 1 Greg for a little reminder of how things take time to settle in. Awesome chaos from the triplets. Cricket was great. I love how Danielle goes to CGI at every opportunity. The green hat. The sloppy green. And scene. Suck it. I don't think you've earned the right to be sarcastic. Revenge is way sweeter and stuff. Julia phoning it in. The live task was also excellent. Please pive pe pive points. I'm a real piece of shit. Julia as a mob boss. Don't milk it. Tom you piece of shit. Julia oscillates between proper funny and a weird trying too hard to be cool with the youth vibe. We're in our 50s Julia, everyone knows it, it's ok! Still lots of problems with the edit, but the studio sessions are getting better. Howzat!"
45,113ldl3_00046,Nina if you're reading this nice hair this episode.
46,113ldl3_00047,"Oh my gosh, Julia's appeal is something else."
47,113ldl3_00048,Luke’s throwing is unexpectedly good.
48,113ldl3_00049,"I am blown away every week with how well they've done the Australian adaptation. The talent, the chemistry, I'm in stitches and awe constantly. Edit: like the post-task dance twist omg"
49,113ldl3_00050,"I think the team task scoring was a bit too harsh on the team of 3, but it's fun to see Tom G be harsh but (mostly) fair in scoring. I think AU is off to a strong start, these 5 contestants are fun and they've had some strong tasks. Greater Tom reminds me of early series Greg before he softened up on scoring, and Lesser Tom is a fun assistant. As they get their legs under them I think this will become another beloved adaptation."
50,113ldl3_00051,"Can't believe it's another week of Taskmaster AU already! I'm currently watching the first episode of Guy Montgomery's Guy Mont-Spelling Bee instead of having The Project on mute like I usually do. It's so bloody good, if you guys love Taskmaster NZ, you'll love this."
51,113ldl3_00052,"""Individual team task"" is a new spin on things... Danielle being on the much competent duo team basically seals her the win imo"
52,113ldl3_00053,Tom calling out Nina was great.
53,113ldl3_00054,"Got so excited to see the teams I made a very weird noise. Also, love the self-awareness of Tom commenting on advertisers ""flogging their wares"". I know Greg does the same. But it feels like he's speaking to those of us tuning in and plowing through tons of infuriating ads (not usually being the types to watch hours of commercial TV, given how much crap is on there) to make sure that they keep Taskmaster on the air."
54,113ldl3_00055,Danielle's appeal is nightmare fuel.
55,113ldl3_00056,oh julia’s good
56,113ldl3_00057,"I don't know if this is a controversial opinion, but I think Taskmaster AU works better than Taskmaster NZ. Obviously NZ season 2 was lightning in a bottle, but the other two series I stopped watching after a few episodes - Paul is great, but Jeremy adds so little that it's completely up to the contestants whether the studio segments work. So you need five incredible contestants for it to come together, and if something is a bit medium the studio can't elevate it. Greg and Alex are great at this obviously, but I think Gleeson does a decent job here. He's a bit chipper and still settling in, but doing a pretty good job. I don't love Cashman in the role, but he sets a decent pace and doesn't drag anything down. So overall I'm still enthusiastic about this in a way that I wasn't about NZ 1 or 3, and think it could grow to be genuinely great."
57,113ldl3_00058,"The Julia and Danielle special task was cleverly done. First time they're ever tried to do a trick-team-task. But I wanted more of the juicy Josh Widdicombe/Mark Watson ""I can't believe you made me do this and nobody else had to"" moment."
58,113ldl3_00059,"I don't know enough about cricket, but I feel like this would be a fun task for Jeremy as TM"
59,113ldl3_00060,"As a cricket fan, I feel like Gleeson added the criteria ""best knowledge of cricket appeals wins"". JImmy's was good, but I absolutely LOVED Nina's Shakespearean reimagining of the game and Julia's ""appeal"". Great episode, but I got gripes with Gleeson's scoring."
60,113ldl3_00061,"They establish that the shovel is completely useless and still give it 4 points seemingly at random. Odd. I worry they're quickly going down the route of UK Taskmaster, where the contestants soon realized it's not really worth trying with the prize tasks since they're largely ranked at random."
61,113ldl3_00062,I just realised that this is the first episode no one was disqualified. Well done team!
62,113ldl3_00063,"Ah yes, Bob, the Green Hat."
63,113ldl3_00064,"Okay so Prize task - pretty accurate scoring well done greater Tom - you are growing on me! You know your brief my concerns from episode 1 of too much pedant and being over the top mean have been quashed - loving him. Yes he’s still a bit mean and a bit pedantic but that’s what you want from a TM, it’s not over the top which was my concern on episode 1. Thong task - love it if only for being a Brit by birth and an Aussie by citizenship and heart. I’d love to see thongs become the Aussie duck - in every series just because it’s quintessentially Australian and can be quite versatile in a task. Great concept loved the different levels of responses. Great task all around- good ideas from Nina and Danielle. Great straightforward masculine thinking from the men and some lovely lateral thinking from Julia. Just and all round nice task Oooh team task I queried this last week was told by responders that team tasks do happen. Sorry triplets but the twins had it - be glad it wasn’t a 5-0 split. The Macarena was fun, I wonder if it was a single team task or just ridiculous for the other team to do? Either way good on you ladies! And nice for the show to have a point of difference/newness without breaking the mold completely. Cricket - something else I’d be okay with being an Aussie Taskmaster reoccurring theme of cricket - I don’t know anything about cricket - call me Nina! That’s where my knowledge lies. Great to get an Aussie spin to the show without us all learning cricket (sorry UK fam I know you hold season tickets to see cricket but I just don’t get it!!). Love the different versions to appealing. Scoring again on point! Well done Tom and thanks crew for leaving in the explanations it makes the world of difference when compared to NZ that doesn’t always have an explanation- they have gotten better at this (not sure if that was Jeremy or the editors cutting it but it’s nice to see the justifications here and prize task and others from all 3 episodes) Live task - brilliant! That last round was totally a win for Luke, sadly I’d have kept Jimmy over him on the previous round but soooo glad Tom had a different POV to me! Luke for the win on that one for sure! Even I audibly said to no one “oooh that’s a close one” (non audibly adding but I’d pick luke) One of the ad break links to forget the streaming services - that’s how we are all watching it!!! We want our viewing figures to count! You have your own service on own web page - don’t discount it! Very enjoyable - good to see Julia get a win I may be mis-remembering but I feel that’s all 3 ladies in for a win each so good onya gals! Lesser Tom I’m still not vibing with as well as some of the other international series but that’s okay it’s a big role and lesser Tom Im sure will get there he has arguably the biggest boots to fill. Enjoying this series. I love love Jimmy from YouTube - “Shut the border!!!” - I’m too new to Australia/too old to remember him from Giggle and hoot but love the little digs of “4 comedians and 1 children’s TV presenter” very very classic way for the TM to introduce the contestants and at least proves that Charlotte Richie could be both - Jimmy is! Great series loving it. I’ve been reserving judgement in case had 1 flukes good episode but 3 in I feel it’s safe to call it we have a winner."
64,113ldl3_00065,Danielle is nailing the prize tasks.
65,113ldl3_00066,This is gonna be chaos
66,113ldl3_00067,Great idea for a live task!
67,113ldl3_00068,"Oh, almost anyone can win."
68,113ldl3_00069,"re: Julia's fly I'd allow it. I thought that was one of the more clever ""working within the rules"" bits."
69,113ldl3_00070,"For the live task I kind of wish the paddles were blindly chosen. For the prize task, maybe a tin can on a string phone system. Or a flag on a six foot pole. Getting out if accidentally buried is certainly one tack. Another is the Chinese tradition of burying your body with items that you will enjoy in the afterlife. If you lead with that, you can bury yourself with favorite foods, fake or real money, maybe a video game console, whatever. For the thong task, if I were able to get to a post office and mailed the thong to a foreign address within the time period, would it have counted?"
70,113ldl3_00071,"Oh god, Danielle's going full Kongen Befaler..."
71,113ldl3_00072,Some nice roasts by Tom.
72,113ldl3_00073,Don't think the triplets are going to win this one
73,113ldl3_00074,"I thought the triplets were awesome. Disagree with Gleeson, reckon he's blinded by his hatred of improv troops, haha. Chemistry between Nina, Luke, and Jimmy feels like it's going to be absolutely chaotic, and I'm into it."
74,113ldl3_00075,Liked this episode a lot but still waiting for the ‘banter’ to really click between the two Toms but I think they are slowly growing into their respective roles. It’s exciting to see!
75,113ldl3_00076,"I'm with Nina. WTF is a cricket appeal? Also, I feel like I missed the connection between eggs and twins/triplets. Is there one? I also had no idea what the ""triplet"" was trying to do with the eggs on their heads and the question/honking. Yet somehow I was still thoroughly entertained."
76,113ldl3_00077,Worm bit made me cackle
77,113ldl3_00078,"Very randomly, I have the exact same tin kookaburra statue. Ten bucks from Kmart - hopefully didn’t stretch the budget too much"
78,113ldl3_00079,"""How many times has the moon has an annurism?"""
79,113ldl3_00080,Oh this is a good live task
80,113ldl3_00081,"Honestly, a decent episode, but probably the weakest in the series so far. It got better towards the end."
81,113ldl3_00082,"Another good show giving most everyone time to shine. I thought the cricket bit dragged on, but then again I don’t understand cricket, haha. TM Tom seemed to dislike CGI, which has been debated here before, but he came up with a valid reason to discredit it. Similarly I’m sure they will allow it in a future task."
82,113ldl3_00083,Jimmy Rees is the Richard Osman of this season
83,113ldl3_00084,"Whoa, Nina went dark with her prize task."
84,113ldl3_00085,Shouldn't it at LEAST have been Taskmaster-sama.
85,113ldl3_00086,"This is chalking up to be one of my favorite seasons. Love the cast, and while I wish Gleeson was as mean as he was on Hard Quiz, he works well as the Taskmaster. The tasks have been spot on too!"
86,113ldl3_00087,After the cross from Tom I worried they’d call it a flip flop in the task. So glad they stayed true to ‘thong’
87,113ldl3_00088,"""What is your name?"" Wow, these are some shit riddles"
88,113ldl3_00089,im looking forward to seeing more of this dance
89,113ldl3_00090,"I'm with Nina and Lesser Tom here, no idea what's going on. And as I wrote that Tom just explained."
90,113ldl3_00091,Great fakeout Lesser Tom.
91,113ldl3_00092,Is this the first time a team task has a 5-1 point split? Usually it's 5-3 point split. Not that I disagree with the Taskmaster tho.
92,113ldl3_00093,This laugh track i cant haha. Remember when people went to the live taping and they were like guys its fine but they didnt know they would do us like this
93,113ldl3_00094,Omg yesssss team task! YES!
94,113ldl3_00095,OOOOH TEAM TASK TIME!
95,113ldl3_00096,
96,113ldl3_00097,"Are 10play ads targeted? Mine are all superfunds and luxury cars. If so, who do they think I am? If not, who do they think taskmasters audience is?"
97,113ldl3_00098,Tom Gleeson certainly knows a good cricket appeal.
98,113ldl3_00099,"""Revenge is way sweeter and stuff!"""
99,113ldl3_00100,40.38 metres1?1 was that the epic throw?!
100,113ldl3_00101,WHO DID THE TIME!!!
101,113ldl3_00102,Can I steal that hammer for a dedede cosplay?
102,113ldl3_00103,"solid episode, but i wish the editing was better"
103,113ldl3_00104,"I think this has just been a really good series so far, like I’ve been enjoying it. I definitely feel like one of the women will take it in the end."
104,113ldl3_00105,"Ooh, this prize task is going to be good."
105,113ldl3_00106,Genius move from Jimmy. He saw a loophole in that prize task and he went for it.
106,113ldl3_00107,It was an amazing throw!
107,113ldl3_00108,Is this filmed at the same place as the NZ taskmaster?
108,113ldl3_00109,"When in doubt, wear a brown hat."
109,113ldl3_00110,"I enjoyed the episode, but there wasn't really anything stand-out to me. I thought Jimmy's cell phone when getting buried alive was the best option for the prize task (reminds me of Buried). The thong flight felt like it could have been much more fun. Julia's idea was interesting, but I thought there were a lot more ways to simulate ""flying"" to get around the rules. The team task with ""The Eggs Three"" was a funny idea, especially after meeting for the first time (that's a fun group). I felt like the execution could have gone off better (there were no replacement eggs after they broke?), but it was cute to see them vibing in the moment. Danny-L's (yes, that's how I'm spelling it) superimposed head during the cricket game was also amusing, but still somehow missed something to push it over the edge. The studio task of appealing to the taskmaster was probably my favorite task of the night. I can't help but feel that Julia's ""seductively"" attempt got completely butchered, though. I'm getting sick of this family friendly format, and I still feel like Gleeson is one of the most disagreeable TMs."
110,113ldl3_00111,Episode really picking up with Nina and Danielle's thong tasks
111,113ldl3_00112,I'm curious of what Tom will think of Julia's thong.
112,113ldl3_00113,I like this team task idea.
113,113ldl3_00114,
0,119s7kc_00001,"Only on Episode 2 atm, but as a brit who loves the original this has left me with a rather big grin watching this, seems a lot more light hearted than the other shows. Can't say i've ever heard of Nina before but she seems like the most fun person i've seen on TV in a while, definatly want her to win!"
1,119s7kc_00002,"I don't think they should have given Luke points for the yeast-spread task. The task was to get the thing clean in the fastest time, and regardless of whether he declared himself to be done, his arm wasn't clean. I understand for stuff like the boat where everyone got a little wet, but you it seems unfair to just allow ""declaring yourself to be finished"" as a valid way to stop the clock early."
2,119s7kc_00003,"I don't like the AU assistant or taskmaster as much as even the NZ ones, but the contestants and show overall have been top notch."
3,119s7kc_00004,How many minutes is the show without ad breaks? It feels like the UK version has much more ‘room to breathe’ and AU version ends up feeling like they’re trying to cram a load of things in. Makes me think about editing a lot more than I usually do 😂
4,119s7kc_00005,"I'm assuming the network couldn't clear the episode title as ""It was full of Ebola""."
5,119s7kc_00006,"For once, I agree with the verdict for the prize task. Crazy inflatable arm guy was definitely the coolest item. Poor Nina kept botching all the assignments this episode, but somehow that just makes it all the more charming. Sink the floating bowling ball was such a cruel trick! For the snap, crackle, pop task, I really wish they'd let Danielle take that axe to the exercise ball. By the way, it's funny that Jimmy found those perfect 'crackling' egg shells in the trash, since we saw Tom cracking all those eggs for the commercial breaks. ""Generic yeast infection,"" hehe. Luke's Vegemite task was so fun, playing ""guess which hand"" and all. But bless Julia for covering herself in it; I thought she was going to go for the goodies. Gras with one S, that's exactly the excuse I would have used if they dared to penalize me. Honk a car horn the quietest -- that's a good tiebreak! I wonder if Jimmy's attempt to muffle it is what got him the edge. So far everyone has won an episode, it should be Luke's turn next. This version is definitely growing on me by the week. Gleeson and Cashman are settling into their roles well."
6,119s7kc_00007,"I went to the taping of this one back in December. A few things I remember that didn't make the cut: Nina claimed her original prize task was going to be actual (Australian Prime Minister) Anthony Albanese, but he had to drop out because he got Covid. No idea if she was telling the truth or not (though he did have Covid at the time). There was a running gag where Nina appointed herself as Luke's legal counsel during the piss or water discussion, though she dropped him as a client when her own points were put at risk. We got a snippet of it in the final edit, but watching Nina's reaction to the bowling ball task in real time was glorious. I think she hid behind her chair at one point. There was an extended diagloue about Danielle wanting to make the best pop by firing a gun at a jumping castle. I figured that was ending up on the cutting room floor when someone (probably Jimmy) added the words ""school fete"" to the scenario. Lesser Tom's jacket didn't look as nearly clean in person. Maybe it was the studio lighting, but it seemed to have a grubby brown sheen to it that the cameras didn't capture. While they were setting up the stage for the live task, the warm-up comedian asked Jimmy to swear in his Jimmy Giggle voice. Jimmy Giggle told him to fuck off. The live task went on a lot longer, a lot of indecipherable nonsense was edited out of Danielle and Julia's attempt. The other team's attempt was presented pretty much as is, but it took Tom waaaay longer to guess the Berlin Wall and Dolly the Sheep."

9,119s7kc_00010,"This episode has definitely solidified Nina as my favourite of the lineup. She approaches every task with such a sense of innocence and childlike wonder, comes out thinking she’s aced it, and has usually done terribly. At least she’s a good sport about it."
10,119s7kc_00011,"I love that Luke reinvented Sausage or Finger, the next evolution of the sport."
11,119s7kc_00012,Has any assistant openly laughed as much as Tom? I kind of love it
12,119s7kc_00013,Lot of bathroom accidents for Luke today. He should see a doctor.
13,119s7kc_00014,"This week's episode was fantastic. Prize task was rushed but everything after that was top level. Very clever sequencing of the tasks as well because we got: -The callback of the bowling ball in the lake in a later task, and -Luke admitting to peeing his pants and then having to admit to pooing his pants later Also loved: -Nina's ""redacted"" -The generic yeast spread task got especially chaotic with Julia and Jimmy. And Luke also coming up with ""guess the hand."" Really great tasks and the live one was strong as well!"

20,119s7kc_00021,Jimmy’s balloon pop tension was PALPABLE.
21,119s7kc_00022,I love that they censored Nina's lligitamete noises so they couldn't be judged.

23,119s7kc_00024,"I had to admit, when Julia Morris was announced for this show, I was dreading it. But it's great to see her manic early Full Frontal persona come back and she's won me back over! This is such a great cast! I hope latter seasons will also have such great ensembles."

30,119s7kc_00031,"Ooh, Tom being reasonable was something I didn't expect."
31,119s7kc_00032,Mmm generic rice and generic yeast spread. Perfect for a well rounded generic breakfast
32,119s7kc_00033,"I totally would have covered Tom in Vegemite. Like, smeared it over him. EDIT: YES, JIMMY!"
33,119s7kc_00034,"Oh God Julia, no"
34,119s7kc_00035,luke getting so caught up in playing with the generic yeast spread he invents “which hand is my hand” is a top tm moment of all time for me
35,119s7kc_00036,Just have to say again that I LOVE Julia. She’s brilliant. Spreading the vegemite on herself is exactly what I would’ve done and she did it with so much pazaaz. Gràs was hilarious too. She’s really making the season for me. Close is Nina who’s always excellent and occasionally terrible at tasks.
36,119s7kc_00037,Nice to see we've now got the inverse of Laura Daniel's brussel sprout task.
37,119s7kc_00038,I love it when Julia just gets things done.

40,119s7kc_00041,Good editing!
41,119s7kc_00042,So generic yeast spread covered real arm or generic yeast spread covered fake arm will be a live task next season?
42,119s7kc_00043,🤣 How do Jimmy and Julia have the same idea TWICE in one episode?!
43,119s7kc_00044,The crab trap sinking but the bowling ball popping back up was surprisingly satisfying and hilarious.
44,119s7kc_00045,Holy fuck the ten play app is a nightmare.
45,119s7kc_00046,"I love how much of a disaster Nina was this episode! This is like classic taskmaster, and all the taped tasks were really good imo"
46,119s7kc_00047,Oh Luke.
47,119s7kc_00048,"Another solid episode. The editing seems good, while that was a concern for many here. I liked the juxtaposition of the tasks Luke claimed bathroom malfeasance and how all three of Nina’s failures were tied together. The pacing is still a bit off. No banter section, a rushed studio task. Seems like they wanted to get more out of the prize task but it wasn’t that interesting. I guess the double task took extra time, and we still got Luke’s “which is my real hand” game, haha!"
48,119s7kc_00049,"I think this has been my favourite episode of this series, great tasks all round and great moments in every task - hopefully this is a sign of more good things to come!"
49,119s7kc_00050,Julia's snap is chef's kiss
50,119s7kc_00051,"My first thought with the spread was to cover Lesser Tom, so was happy to see what Jimmy did. Was getting major David Correos vibes from Nina this episode with her being so proud of her efforts while remaining completely oblivious to the truth."
51,119s7kc_00052,"Yuck, genetic yeast spread is what us ladies have to go to see a doctor for."
52,119s7kc_00053,Even I was backing away from that balloon popping
53,119s7kc_00054,How did they get that much vegemite? Did some poor PA have to empty a 1000 jars into that large container?
54,119s7kc_00055,"The series scores are really interesting so far! Just 2 points separating Danielle, Jimmy and Julia at the top! I reckon Nina and Luke are still just close enough to catch up - for comparison, they're 15-16 points behind 1st place, but after the 4th episode of UK S14 Dara was already 30 points ahead of John Kearns... Nina's had 2 really rough eps in a row now score-wise (a Marrickville banh mi absolutely deserved more than some random menu for the prize task) so maybe that balances out in the future? But um, should we be worried about Julia? Is this what happens when a properly funny comic gets worn down by years of hosting B-grade Australian reality TV?"
55,119s7kc_00056,"Another solid episode. My primary point for improvement from Taskmaster AU at this stage, is that, based off the insights given by people who've been to the live tapings, I feels like there is a heap of great banter on the stage that is being cut out. The vibe between the cast members seems really good, but the editors are just not finding the time (particularly in the studio tasks) to display some more of that. Partially, this is clearly due to Ch10/Paramount demanding six ad breaks *shudder*. In one sense, I feel like the editors hands are tied, because there are things like the reading out of the scores that do NEED to be kept in at the expense of much funnier stuff. On the other hand, I happen to think that this banter is part of what makes Taskmaster great (think about when Greg pulls Nish Kumar and James Acaster to the back of the stage, iconic!). And I'm hoping that the AU team comes to realise the importance of the backstage-green-room-style banter on stage as everyone gains confidence with the format."
56,119s7kc_00057,"Nina is hilarious. She just never realised it was floating, I love her 😂"
57,119s7kc_00058,"Mmmmmm, generic rice..."
58,119s7kc_00059,The cut back to the bowling ball was gold!
59,119s7kc_00060,"Oof, pretty poor prize task this week. As evidenced by how short the segment was."
60,119s7kc_00061,"""that's human faeces"""
61,119s7kc_00062,Oh sweet innocent Nina
62,119s7kc_00063,I wish we could've seen Danielle use an axe on the exercise ball.
63,119s7kc_00064,"Oh poor Nina, twice in one episode"
64,119s7kc_00065,"Oh god, please don't tell me Nina's fucked it again."

69,119s7kc_00070,Loved Episode 4. The spreading task in particular was great stuff. A part of me wished Jimmy did Tom’s face.
70,119s7kc_00071,Oh that's a really good task idea.
71,119s7kc_00072,This is gold
72,119s7kc_00073,"Had to leave and come back from the yeast task. I was in hysterics watching Julia and Jimmy's task attempt. Best episode so far this series, and it's great that no contestant has won a second episode yet, it's been pretty even. Well, apart from Luke. No idea if he will win an episode."
73,119s7kc_00074,I see where they got the episode title now...
74,119s7kc_00075,"The shot of Nina next to the lake, oblivious to her floating bowling was amazing. I wish they would have the little sketch between the Toms at the start of the episode like in the UK version. Otherwise they barely ever talk directly to each other. I'm becoming more convinced that the editors of the studio segments are just the same people who do the Bachelor and Survivor and they just have no sense of comedy so any good bits are there by accident. Despite that, I think this is going to be one of my favorite seasons of any version and I'm glad as an Aussie that the show isn't a dud"
75,119s7kc_00076,"Thanks to a clip posted by Taskmaster AU on social media, this episode is called ""Boom Boom Boom Boom."""

Brilliant call backs from production/editing team with it being shown later as well as with Luke and his pissed pants/not wet from the first task (I missed that in the first 10mins but saw the end of the studio chat on that and inferred from context) and later with the it's poo not yeast spread later. Can't wait to watch it in full as I made dinner and missed heaps - I want to see Nina's face the first time she realises it floats when she saw the other contestants efforts, I also want to see the prize task which I completely missed."

1,11fx06s_00002,Just catching up on this episode after missing it the night it aired. Oh my word. I've just watched the roses task and I have tears streaming down my face. Poor Danielle!! Couldn't see the forest for the trees bless her. 😂😂😂😂 And Jimmy's dummy spit was funny too. Loved the popcorn task. Julia and Luke's solutions were far better than I had in mind.
2,11fx06s_00003,"Finally catching up on this. I love how Luke is so shit on prize tasks every single episode. ""Hey look, I brought in this cool thing, and it fits the task because... oh wait... it really doesn't."" Loved the alphabeth task. That was ingenious, and if IIRC one of two tasks Tom Cashman wrote (he was brought onto the show at a relatively late stage, so by that time most tasks had already been written). Danielle's attempt was what you would describe as ""totally drawing a blank"". :D Not agreeing with the scoring of the live task. Team of 3 had the far better letters."
3,11fx06s_00004,"Apart from the horrendous timing of ads (hence why I've gone elsewhere on YT to get the episode), I can see that the show is showing a significant improvement over the season. The cast is getting more into it, the Tom's are now finding their niches in their roles, and the show is flowing a lot more. As I recall saying, every first season of Taskmaster in the world is hit-and-miss, and Australia is no exception. But it's growing significantly, and if it does get renewed for a second season, then that second season should be smashing."

7,11fx06s_00008,Danielle is the funniest contestant this series by far. I've laughed out loud at her multiple episodes.
8,11fx06s_00009,I don't think I've ever seen a Taskmaster's Assistant literally cry laughing.
9,11fx06s_00010,"So, as promised, here's what got cut from the studio recording: Nina told a very long, winding story about her gay door for the prize task. There were a lot of questions about what the two holes were for (the one at hip level seemed fairly obvious, but she never really answered what the hole at eye level was for). She said that it was a really mouldy door, and that the mould was also part of the art. The 26 roses task was obviously batshit insane, and there was way more studio chat about how frustrating everyone found it - especially Danielle. She said that it was the last task she filmed on a Friday, and a producer actually asked her if she wanted to come back on Monday to finish it off so they could all go home. She said no, because she'd be too embarrassed if she still couldn't figure it out over the weekend. I don't think anything significant was cut from the team task with the giraffe, but I just want to add that I found the image of Danielle and Julia running in bathrobes/onesies hilarious. There was a very long break while the crew set up the live task and contestants changed into their overalls, and then another long break afterwards while they changed the set from live task to displaying all the prizes. During this final break, the cast and crew held an impromptu Q&A session. They all seemed to have a great time making Taskmaster, and at the time didn't know when the show would air or if it would be renewed for another series. Tom Gleeson also mentioned that their producer (or maybe director?) was also named Tom, and joked that if you were a white man named Tom, you were almost guaranteed a job at Taskmaster. I also wrote down that I got the impression that Julia was doing well in the series overall - looks like I was right! I just want to add that I was very skeptical of this series before it aired, based on what I knew of the cast beforehand. I'm so happy that the series is turning out to be brilliant, hilarious and original."

13,11fx06s_00014,"Tom's fucking crying, this is fantastic"
14,11fx06s_00015,"It's really important that you need to know that after the roses task, Danielle immediately started crying, they threw to commercial break immediately and Nina the complete sweetheart got out of her chair to immediately go over and hug her. Love these idiots."
15,11fx06s_00016,
16,11fx06s_00017,1.5 HOURS?! Poor Lesser Tom
17,11fx06s_00018,"OK, no more doubts here - that was just a flat-out great episode! Greater Tom looked a lot more comfortable in the studio, great banter, great and delightfully bad task performances, Lesser Tom losing it, and even the studio editing seems to have gotten its act together. Oh, and some proper filthy language, even if it did get muted ;) WOO HOO!"
18,11fx06s_00019,"You can hear the loathing from the audience for Jimmy’s vinyl even before it’s revealed he has no record player. That’s a hall-of-fame TM prize for me. :-) Later, when Danielle’s brain ejected a tie rod onto the path and into our hearts, it felt to me like this series at last caught fire and started to move. Now this is Taskmaster! ;-) The ensuing giraffe and live tasks happily confirmed that. If the remaining episodes sustain this level of quality, we have a treat in store! :-)"
19,11fx06s_00020,I’m really starting to appreciate Tom Cashman’s “just happy to be here” energy
20,11fx06s_00021,"I don’t know if anyone else thinks this but I feel like they’ve toned down the canned laughter from the first few episodes, the laughter and pacing in general feels a lot more natural!"

26,11fx06s_00027,"Little Alex Horne and Paul would have eaten the popcorn anyway, though."
27,11fx06s_00028,"All of the women in this series are brilliant. I loved the reveal that Julia guessed the c-word four times. Nina’s improv joke was delightful. (‘Yes, and that was really mean.’) And, apart from providing one of the all-time Taskmaster highlights, Danielle’s vocabulary in her guesses really impressed me."
28,11fx06s_00029,"Did anyone pick up on Nina's great little ""yes, and"" joke?"
29,11fx06s_00030,"I’ve come to the conclusion that Luke is the worst prize task contestant of any contestant who puts time and effort into the prize task. He comes up with a concept, chooses a wholly unimpactful way to express that concept, and is lucky to get a single point."
30,11fx06s_00031,"""What the f*ck am I going to do with you, Nina?"""
31,11fx06s_00032,Can't believe I called Nina's rose attempt shithouse
32,11fx06s_00033,"""I think we need to knock out Tom"""
33,11fx06s_00034,"This was a very funny episode. Taskmaster Australia has really hit its stride mid-season. I find it most amusing when people fail absolutely at the task. Danielle slowly figuring out the alphabet clue was both excruciating and somehow cathartic. And watching the ""bad improv group"" keep touching grass had almost a natural comedy rhythm to it (although it's fun just watching those three do anything). The live task was also a disaster in the best way because it's extremely difficult to figure out how to build a front-facing ""S"" in 10 seconds. I feel bad that Nina's (disqualified) attempt to hide the popcorn was subverted by a loose kernel, but Luke and Julia sabotaging the bucket by making it completely unappealing and inedible was a great way to subvert the ""build a fort"" task. I almost wonder if Alex Horne would have eaten it anyway. Luke accidentally tossing the roses in slow motion and then blaming it on ""hayfever"" was hilarious (as was his Matrix69 password). Seeing the giraffe riding a bike (""Look how cool he looks on the bike, though"") made me laugh harder than I care to admit. I want to say my biggest criticism with TM AU right now are the episode titles. They come off as pretty generic. (This one was ""Are You Okay?"")"
34,11fx06s_00035,"So, when I watch puzzly Taskmaster tasks, I can’t help using them as a barometer for which contestants I could maybe cold-invite to come on my puzzle-solving podcast. I’m... not so sure I should try asking any of these guys. On the plus side, Gleeson is absolutely on fire tonight. Also, he may not have gotten the puzzle quickly, but Luke’s guesses make him sound like I want him as a friend!"
35,11fx06s_00036,They broke Danielle's brain!!!
36,11fx06s_00037,Jimmy's fits of rage are the best
37,11fx06s_00038,"I cannot get enough of this cast! I think they're settling into their flow at this point in the series, and Nina and Luke being woeful at most things makes them all the more likable. EDIT: I just got through Danielle's try at the password game and I am dying. That was tremendous on every level."
38,11fx06s_00039,"""You dropped a rose"" Oh that's so mean from Tom"
39,11fx06s_00040,I have a sinking feeling the team of three have fucked it.
40,11fx06s_00041,"I said a few weeks ago that people don't tend to take advantage of the rare non-timed task as much as they could, and that really showed in the password task. What they should've done was go fetch a pen and paper to keep track of all their guesses and whether they'd been accepted, analysing the list to look for the pattern. And they should've walked up and down the path looking for clues - wondering why there were roses, wondering why there were 26 passwords, ect. And they should've been really carefully having a think about their guesses, instead of just chucking out random words. But the instinct is to just jump in and get on with it, and that's exactly what you don't want to do when it's ""fewest attempts wins,"" and you're not being timed."
41,11fx06s_00042,HOW DO YOU COINCEDENTALLY GET ALL OF THEM RIGHT IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER IN A WAY THAT SHOWS YOU'RE CLEARLY TRYING TO GET THEM IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER AND THEN NOT GET IT RI- I genuinely don't think I've ever seen an attempt like that in Taskmaster history before.
42,11fx06s_00043,"I was at the studio record for this ep! I wrote down as much as I could remember on the day, so I’ll share what got cut at the end of the episode. Rest assured this is a brilliant and hilarious ep"
43,11fx06s_00044,"Oh no, they're saving Danielle for last. That can't be good. Waiting for hilarity."
44,11fx06s_00045,“Lifting a giraffe is a man’s job.”
45,11fx06s_00046,Twitter Nina would've said that her boys were heading to the cock war instead of the giraffe war.
46,11fx06s_00047,That was the best live task of any taskmaster I've ever seen. I'm in tears!
47,11fx06s_00048,"If anybody’s interested, the current overall scores for the halfway point of the season is:"
48,11fx06s_00049,"TM AU has been fantastic, and this week will no doubt be one of my favourite episodes from any version. The roses task in particular was an outstanding piece of television!"
49,11fx06s_00050,Luke might be my new favorite contestant of all time.
50,11fx06s_00051,I love these contestants. I feel like they all 100% bought into the spirit of the game.
51,11fx06s_00052,"Okay, definitely my favourite episode of the series"
52,11fx06s_00053,Best. Episode. Ever. Danielle outdid herself and it was glorious.
53,11fx06s_00054,Oh psychological warfare from Julia and Luke. I love it.
54,11fx06s_00055,I think that episode is my favourite so far. Well done Julia.
55,11fx06s_00056,"they posted a teaser on twitter involving the rose task....and they said ""it's the funniest task so far"" i thought they were just being over the top.......they weren't holy fuck Danielle"
56,11fx06s_00057,"I think we can safely say this is the end of time-irrelevant tasks on Taskmaster AU - that is to say, tasks that're neither time limited nor assessed based on speed. I figured out the passwords pretty quickly, but I'll admit that I was kinda helped by Taskmaster NZ having a similar one. After Julia and Danielle effortlessly finished the team task, I knew that this wouldn't make the air unless the team of 3 did really, really badly. In the live task, I felt the team of 3 had a disadvantage with one more person than they really needed. I'm fully in favour of the team of 3 being officially called ""The Bad Improv Group."""
57,11fx06s_00058,The live task at the end was an ingenious idea that I can imagine Lord Davies and L.A Horne wishing they’d kept for themselves!
58,11fx06s_00059,“I’ve got poopoo hands” from Julia is surely a new addition to the TM quote book
59,11fx06s_00060,"I am so surprised that none of them picked up the alphabet from the outset. 26 is such a specific number, the first thing I said to myself was just start going a-b-c (though i would have been screwed by saying C and them taking it as sea since it was words and then getting caught up at the letter S). And I'm usually an idiot when it comes to these things."
60,11fx06s_00061,I have never heard the word ‘Mongoose’ said as mournfully as by Danielle in the studio after the password task.
61,11fx06s_00062,Julia looks lovely tonight.
62,11fx06s_00063,"The spit, sweet jesus"
63,11fx06s_00064,they were really hyping this task and it delivered!
64,11fx06s_00065,"I love a Prize Task where the TM isn't just picking the ones he likes the best, but in this case which ones irritate him the most. I haven't seen many of those out of the UK, but I've seen less than half the seasons so far."
65,11fx06s_00066,"Poor Danielle. Besides David with the shoelaces and Guz's revelations in the lab, this is the longest anyone has taken to do a task (at least in the English speaking versions of the show), right? Edit: I meant tasks where the contestant had completed the task before they left, and there wasn’t something still ongoing."
66,11fx06s_00067,"No fucking way, we're halfway through already?! Incredible. After last week's episode, Nina Oyama teased on her Twitter that tonight's episode has ""one of the most chaotic tasks ever. It is so fucked up."" I can't wait to see that."
67,11fx06s_00068,"Okay, so they can't attack lesser Tom, but could they have tied him up before he came for the popcorn?"
68,11fx06s_00069,"after watching this episode i wanna be best friends with nina, i feel like our combined chaotic adhd lesbian energy would be off the charts"
69,11fx06s_00070,"I wish somebody would upload a video of Danielle’s password task, that was so great."
70,11fx06s_00071,I haven't laughed so unexpectedly hard as I did watching Danielle in the password task.
71,11fx06s_00072,"For the popcorn, I would’ve wrapped plastic wrap (if it’s there) up and over the table enough times so that Tom couldn’t pierce a hole through but long enough that he would get scissors."
72,11fx06s_00073,I’m watching live in WA - I tried to watch live Sydney but the stream kept cutting out so I’m watching it on TV so my viewing figures won’t count sadly but oooooh it hurts I think Danielle is officially my favourite contestant after today. She has it all!
73,11fx06s_00074,I cried laughing at Danielle's password task. Poor thing 😂
74,11fx06s_00075,I just binged all of the episodes but this episode made me laugh from the very beginning. It’s so good? I’m crying so hard
75,11fx06s_00076,I think this is the best episode of the season yet. Everyone got to show some great strengths and some amazing follies. Really goes to show that they casted it well.
76,11fx06s_00077,Best episode so far if there is a second season who would u want on mine Josh Lawson was good on thank god your here and mick molloy listen to him on triple m Sydney he would either be really good or really bad
77,11fx06s_00078,"I feel like this is the only season of Taskmaster I've seen across Uk, NZ and Oz, when being in a team of three is a disadvantage."
78,11fx06s_00079,"Oh my god, this task is amazing"
79,11fx06s_00080,"Oh, Nina..."
80,11fx06s_00081,"those two attempts were shithouse, I love it"
81,11fx06s_00082,Such different energies between the teams.
82,11fx06s_00083,such good tasks all around omg
83,11fx06s_00084,Best episode.
84,11fx06s_00085,"I never would have guessed the alphabet, I would have been there for so long!"
85,11fx06s_00086,Julia's HSC results 😂
86,11fx06s_00087,This is a really totally irrelevant comment but since Gleeson mentioned baths I just wanna say that having like 20 minute long 40 degree baths is sooooooooooo good (and this is backed up by science) and is essentially a mild anti-depressant.
87,11fx06s_00088,If Jimmy's the only person to get points...
88,11fx06s_00089,This episode is really good so far.
89,11fx06s_00090,Good prize task tonight. Shame it'll be rushed again.
90,11fx06s_00091,Oh that is genius
0,11mmj8q_00001,"Damn, this cast is so funny. The aging/de-aging task took the cake for me (Luke: ""Ask me about immigrants.""). Julia as a baby might be the most disturbing thing I've seen in all of Taskmaster. Until I saw Danielle as a 300-year-old hunchback. Watching Cashman trying to hold back laughter was a joy. I love Nina and her antics so much. ""Do you guys want to see a one-handed cartwheel? Nah, I can't be bothered."" ""Looks like you've hit a snag."" ""You're annoying."" Finally, the TM's assistant did their job. I loved Danielle checking the barbecues for clues, trying to figure out if there's any pattern between the food items, and then pointing out the knock-off Barbie doll. I love that she even checked between the legs for authenticity. Gleeson is really good with callbacks from previous episodes (I counted 3 this time). I wonder if those are all off-the-cuff or if he's being fed them at any point? It's an impressive way of tying the series together. The live task was really, really fun. Luke's sexy monster saying ""I love kids"" was so hilariously self-sabotaging. Either way, it couldn't beat Danielle's big-boobed monster declaring ""I'll suck ya."" I was surprised with the score tallies at the end of the episode. I didn't realize how far Julia and Danielle pulled ahead. Which is kind of ironic since I feel like Nina and Luke are my favorite ones there."
1,11mmj8q_00002,"I said it last week, I'll say it again: I love this cast so much. Everyone had standout moments this week and they along with the Toms seem to have found their flow."
2,11mmj8q_00003,"Agree with all that’s been said, especially the brilliance of the live task, but also: how great was it that Jimmy made a suggestion that resulted in him losing points?"
3,11mmj8q_00004,Absolutely my favourite episode so far. OG TM is definitely gonna steal that live task that was amazing.
4,11mmj8q_00005,"I feel it's a missed opportunity for Tom to close the gap between the two leaders and the rest by always scoring the two teams closely together when the improv group wins by a mile. And i noticed when the other team did win earlier, he had no qualms doing the 5-1 split."
5,11mmj8q_00006,Danielles ageing task was so funny
6,11mmj8q_00007,"Luke saying ""I'll bash ya"" had me howling!"
7,11mmj8q_00008,Luke has a direct line to my funny bone. The man has genius timing.
8,11mmj8q_00009,Never been a huge fan of Julia but she's definitely understood the assignment on Taskmaster. I'm really impressed.
9,11mmj8q_00010,Luke missed an opportunity to add a top hat to his monster to make it more prestigious.
10,11mmj8q_00011,"Little late to the show tonight, so here's some notes! Danielle's prize task submission was brilliant. Not quite on the level of Mark stealing Greg's trousers, but still very good! I love how Tom immediately snitched Luke out to Jimmy after Luke sat in the car. I love an assistant that you can't 100% trust. ""I think now is the time for the reveal - no, Julia's just bad."" ""We could've created a sperm sample and just put that on the table"" oh god Luke After that aging task, I'm calling it now. Danielle's winning the series. ""Corn... pumpkin... bread..."" Love the live task too. Thought it was decent after that first one but the escalations made it fantastic. Top 3 of the season."
11,11mmj8q_00012,Is Luke the only contestant to use incontinence as a go-to excuse for incompetence?
12,11mmj8q_00013,I thought Nina did well on the age/de-age task but Danielle blew it out of the water. Couldn't stop laughing and neither could lesser Tom.
13,11mmj8q_00014,"Not being from Australia, I knew nothing about these contestants six weeks ago, but I think I’ve got them figured out now. Except Danielle. Danielle is an enigma. She can be so smart, creative and practical. She looks innocent, but sometimes an inner maniac comes out. She’s really committed to the tasks, without being competitive. I guess I’m like Julia in that RC car task - watching on and admiring Dannielle. In other words, I bloody love her!"
14,11mmj8q_00015,"I love when contestants steal from each other. Trophies, shoes, girlfriends. So much fun!"
15,11mmj8q_00016,Luke and his sperm idea. Oh my god!!! He really likes to talk about bodily function
16,11mmj8q_00017,"I really enjoy the fact that they are very willing to do callbacks and references to previous episodes in a way that other TM series don't. The entire idea of the Dancing Queens and their secret non-task requires that Greater Tom recap it every week for the sake of the studio audience, but that also seems to be opening them up to doing more cross-referential things like bringing up Danielle's biography of her whole life. The banter between the two Toms is definitely improving, and I feel like Lesser Tom is starting to find his role in studio more. Prize Task: Any time one contestant steals from another is absolute gold. Luke's decision to go for the joke rather than get the points by bringing in red hair makes sense if he knows he's not going to win, and is now just here to have fun. Julia lucked out in that the other contestants were much worse because she did technically pick something that wasn't being missed. Though stealing from your own child to win a game show is something that seems like it matches her persona. Nina... tried. I was disappointed that we didn't actually get a basketball game to prove if Jimmy or lesser Tom would miss more. I know that there would be no time during filming to do so, but it would have been nice. Team Task: Lesser Tom immediately snitching is fantastic. He's definitely less stoic than the traditional assistant, but I really enjoy the attitude he brings here. I also really liked the fact that Jimmy pointed out that stopping to put on a helmet for no reason at all was wasting them time and could possibly get them to lose, while Nina went for the entertainment value of having an awesome helmet. (Nina, since you're possibly reading this, it was appreciated.) Aging Task: The Benjamin + Button combo was the sort of groan worthy wordplay that we've come to associate with Taskmaster. I honestly thought these were all solid, and that everyone did a fantastic job. Luke's parody of a older conservative man, Jimmy's baby, Nina's old lady just looking for representation, Julia's toddler who probably would have won had she just ended the scene rather than play into lesser Tom's sabotage, and Danielle's elderly lady who managed to win anyways. I totally get why the audience groaned when Tom was willing to accept the 300 years, but at least part of the format is at the Taskmaster is capricious. Barbie Task: I feel bad for the contestants who immediately ruled out the inside of the house because traditionally that's a terrible place to barbecue. While Julia won because she immediately leapt to the idea that it being a Barbie doll Is the sort of nonsense this show would do. I wish that Danielle got a bonus point because it technically wasn't a Barbie, but the Taskmaster is capricious and his word is law. Live Task: This was absolutely brilliant nonsense. Julia being overjoyed that she got eliminated first because she didn't want to draw anymore was fun. I know that the sheer amount of ads is annoying, but part of you actually liked the idea of the final contestants being judged separately. I am unsure that we would have gotten the same sort of back and forth about Luke forgetting to remove ""kids"" from his monster if it was done on stage. Also, it's easy to miss, but Nina is chasing Danielle around stage trying to get her shoes back, which is the sort of chaos that this show thrives on. I hope that Nina did get those shoes back eventually."
17,11mmj8q_00018,"The live studio task is such a good idea, would love for Taskmaster UK to do it’s own twist on this in future series. Danielle pointing out Luke’s still had “I love kids” when trying to be the sexiest had me crying with laughter!"
18,11mmj8q_00019,"I think if Luke had sold the ""I love kids"" on his monster as a desire to procreate he might've been able to steal the win. I thought that was an incredible live task, you knew it was going to have more parts but you couldn't hedge for future rounds without risking elimination in the current round. I'd love to see it adapted for the UK version"
19,11mmj8q_00020,"My favourite thing about TMNZ/AU is the simple 1-4 word tasks that just make me cackle. ""Reinvent the wheel"" has to be on top of that list."
20,11mmj8q_00021,"""just my penis wrapped in a handkerchief"" 😂"
21,11mmj8q_00022,"All the drama that went on with the improv troupes team task was amazing. Tom being a snitch, Jimmy snapping at Nina about the helmet briefly and everything that went on with Luke. P.S. Hi Nina, you read the reddit right? I love how you jumped in from the left of the screen at the start of the team task, good leap!"
22,11mmj8q_00023,The best underrated moment was Nina jumping into frame before the team task.
23,11mmj8q_00024,I just noticed that they planted an Australian flag on NZ soil. I'm worried this might escalate to a war.
24,11mmj8q_00025,"I root for Luke in every episode, I just want that poor man to win one week"
25,11mmj8q_00026,Just wait until there's a do not eat a mint secret rule and Nina immediately broke it
26,11mmj8q_00027,jesus christ luke
27,11mmj8q_00028,I love Tom's expressions
28,11mmj8q_00029,Did anyone see Julia give a little headshake after the others found the snag? She is either going to do really well or really bad on this task. EDIT: really well! She never even saw the other barbies!
29,11mmj8q_00030,Danielle is by far the funniest player. So so funny.
30,11mmj8q_00031,Nina is adorable
31,11mmj8q_00032,Tom saying that Julia was talking about her boob falling out but that was after Lesser Tom blew the whistle.
32,11mmj8q_00033,If Danielle doesn't live to 410 then she had better give back those points. :-D
33,11mmj8q_00034,what a fantastic live task
34,11mmj8q_00035,omg he looks like the cowardly lion
35,11mmj8q_00036,I love Julia's vocal support of Danielle
36,11mmj8q_00037,Holy crap this is a cool task!
37,11mmj8q_00038,I can't stop thinking about the bowl of mints and wonder if there was something hidden in them.
38,11mmj8q_00039,"Wow, lesser Tom is a snitch."
39,11mmj8q_00040,So if we're rating studio outfits for the season I'd say Nina's best was either the blue suit or that green top when she had the Sailor Moon buns and this is Danielle's best.
40,11mmj8q_00041,QLD CHECKING IN! LOVE the prize task. Nina's reaction to Danielle's prize is amazeballs! 😂😂
41,11mmj8q_00042,"My heart sinks whenever Nina gets eliminated. Yes, Gleeson, books are prestigious!"
42,11mmj8q_00043,"Wow, they got us with the reveal."
43,11mmj8q_00044,A SNAG ON THE BARBIE 😭😭
44,11mmj8q_00045,"Oh, Nina."
45,11mmj8q_00046,Danielle has a point 😂
46,11mmj8q_00047,"For every version of Taskmaster, I like to come up with an analogy for the vibe of every particular Taskmaster and Assistant. For example, Alex and Greg are a BDSM gimp and his master. For NZ, Paul is a waiter in the Catskills resort from Dirty Dancing and Jeremy is a newsreader wandered into the wrong set. This episode, I've come up with my analogy for Lesser Tom, perhaps inspired by the aging/de-aging task. He's a little boy who wished himself older a la the movie Big. Not quite sure about Greater Tom yet."
47,11mmj8q_00048,"Another week, and I'm once again turning the TV on at exactly 7:30 only to find the Project is still on. Not even Wierd Al can stop me from muting this shit."
48,11mmj8q_00049,5 points to Danielle. Straight up. Genius.
49,11mmj8q_00050,I feel like Julia and Danielle carried those hands around for the rest of the day after the photo task.
50,11mmj8q_00051,"Paywave Person, lol"
51,11mmj8q_00052,If you watch the show later on ten play does the show still count the views because I always miss the beginning live and like watching it later or the next day and I really want this show back for season 2 Another great episode tonight
52,11mmj8q_00053,This one is going to be wild and potentially horrifying
53,11mmj8q_00054,"If you just disappeared and said ""this is me in a million years"" wuld tom accept it?"
54,11mmj8q_00055,Luke is killing me!
55,11mmj8q_00056,wasn't expecting DDLG to come up on taskmaster tonight
56,11mmj8q_00057,Luigi Mario Party gifset that's Julia Morris Wins By doing Absolutely Nothing.
57,11mmj8q_00058,"Good episode so far. I quite enjoyed the prize task, especially Danielle's prize."
58,11mmj8q_00059,"Plenty of highlights this ep, a lot coming from Luke and Julia as usual, but I also really enjoyed seeing Jimmy get competative in the team task when Nina wanted to wear the helmet. For those watching on 10Play, did it straight up skip an entire ad block for you? Even under normal circumstances, there's so many fewer ads than on TV that trying to watch the 7:30 broadcast seems like a huge mistake."
59,11mmj8q_00060,i really wish the ads hadn't spoiled julia and danielle then
60,11mmj8q_00061,"Another week, another good prize category, another round of shit prizes"
61,11mmj8q_00062,"Oh gosh, this is a disater. I love it."
62,11mmj8q_00063,Why didn't the ball work for Julia and Danielle? Didn't the others do the same thing?
63,11mmj8q_00064,By the way nice outfit Danielle.
64,11mmj8q_00065,"Fellow Aussies, do you reckon Danielle does the voice for those super annoying Powershop ads?"
65,11mmj8q_00066,Really loving the synchronicity of TM AUS and Kongen Befaler both having
66,11mmj8q_00067,
67,11mmj8q_00068,
0,11snpzh_00001,"Catch up time! Missed this when it was on coz of work, so I'm ready to watch and enjoy! Nice work on the prize task Jimmy. Real perfect level of ego destroying. Group task was a lot of fun! I loved the Bad Improv Group's idea. Also, impressive height on that 80's freeze frame jump 😄"
1,11snpzh_00002,"Real episode title: ""My asshole is in heaps of trouble."" I am surprised there was no hurdle in the ""fewest steps"" task? How is anyone able to take the fewest steps without stepping on a hurdle? EDIT: Also having flashbacks to Kongen Befaler where one contestant was disqualified for using a tricycle in a similar task, because in Norwegian a tricycle is called ""step cycle""..."
2,11snpzh_00003,Does anyone know what the Ute is? Is it just a tub Mitsubishi Triton?
3,11snpzh_00004,okay dunking tea very funny too
4,11snpzh_00005,Ok make your parents proud is so funny
5,11snpzh_00006,Okay ive worked out whats weird with tom cashman. I think his words dont match his facial expression
6,11snpzh_00007,"""I just thought you chose to surrender cause you were weak."" -Danielle not understanding the rules."
7,11snpzh_00008,"Luke was robbed for not getting 5 points for kissing Tom. I'm surprised Julia got 5 for that task too, she bassically can't drive in a roundabout ever again."
8,11snpzh_00009,"""Saying I'm old is not an insult - it just means that I own a house and you don't."" 😭 The reality of real estate in Australia."
9,11snpzh_00010,"""If you think someone else is kissing the Taskmaster in MY dream, you're crazy"" 😂"
10,11snpzh_00011,"It has been a while since the studio recording, but I'll do my best to feed you BTS information. Before the show even started, Julia was concerned that her dress was showing too much of her boobs. It sparked an interesting conversation. Lesser Tom did do a banter section with Greater Tom, with the punchline being deliberately awkward, and Greater Tom calling him out on it. They actually had to do it twice because Great Tom's head was too shiny for the cameras, so the whole introduction was redone. That was the only time a segment was re-shot though. There was A LOT cut from the prize task as most of the conversation around Nina's hair, Luke's mask and Danielle's outfit was extremely NSFW. I can't remember exactly, but there may have been discussion about spreading Nina's pubes on the BBQ meat, and there was a lot said about Luke's mask looking like a butthole. After the 'once in a lifetime' task, Lesser Tom offered Nina the chance to pay him less now as he, along with all of us, were pretty sure she wasn't going to win. She refused steadfastly, saying that she still believes she can win, and Lesser Tom reminded her how low she is placing in the competition. In the pizza task, Greater Tom reasonably stated that he wouldn't count hopping, jumping and crawling as steps. All the clips shown in the studio were uncensored, and watching Julia having a breakdown was hilarious. After the pizza task, Lesser Tom withdrew his offer from a very embarrassed Nina. In the live task, after the contestants chose their biscuits, there was another task that said ""Tea or Coffee?"" Lesser Tom wheeled a coffee trolley to each of the contestants and poured their requested beverage. I believe he also gave them the option for milk, which made them joke that they should've had Milo instead. After Julia read out the task, Lesser Tom asked if anyone had any questions, and Luke immediately raised his hand, to the laughter of everyone else. Apparently he did this every live task. Apparently, this was also the only time he asked a good question. The hype man hosted a Q&A while everything was getting set back up. I asked him who he wanted on the show if it got more seasons. Tom Gleeson overheard, looked right at me and proceeded to chastise me for being so negative about the show because I said ""if"" instead of ""when,"" then called me a nerd after telling me to ask the question again properly. When I asked Tom who he wanted ""when"" the show got more seasons, he said that he didn't know because he liked this group too much and couldn't imagine other contestants at that stage. If I recall anything else from the episode, I'll post in the replies."
11,11snpzh_00012,"""But you've got a butthole, obviously"" omg Luke"
12,11snpzh_00013,"My eyes are still wet from the pizza task. God, I love Nina so much. When she flung that slice perfectly at the Italian man: ""That's amore!"" And then the look of utter defeat when she walked into the house and saw Tom sitting there. Undeterred, going back to her bunny hops, tossing that wet lawn pizza at Tom and it lands directly on the ground. ""Dinner is served!"" That's comedy. My second favorite task of the night was when the ""bad improv group"" turned the tables on Tom and forced him to play some TM games. ""HELLO, TOM!"" I love that they got to exact some revenge on him (""All the information you need is in the task"") and the serendipity of the ducks geese ducks getting involved. The final task to ""make your parents proud"" was a brilliant play, and I'll be surprised if it doesn't turn up as a real task in some iteration of the show. Now for some things I didn't like. I hardly ever agree with the prize task rankings. A BBQ being the most surprising thing to bring to a BBQ is pretty lame. I thought Danielle had it for sure with the gimp suit. And I don't like how Gleeson is always picking on Nina! Sure, her Rube Goldberg machine failed, but it still satisfied the requirements of something you do once and never again (vaguely). And I love Julia's dirty mouth, but I hate how overly censored this show is. I hope at some point they put some uncensored outtakes on YouTube or something."
13,11snpzh_00014,"My heart breaks everytime the sheer wholesomeness of Nina gets brutally bashed because of her failed attempts at most things, but she will be the People's Champion. As I've said before, James is a prophet and the People's Champion place is the place of legends, not of winners."
14,11snpzh_00015,Jimmy with the big brain move of awarding Lesser Tom 6 points.
15,11snpzh_00016,"Holy shit, I think she's actually won this one. Edit: I think I'll retract that statement."
16,11snpzh_00017,"Man, it's times like this when I wish it was uncensored, Tom just broke Julia"
17,11snpzh_00018,"""I just thought you chose to surrender because you were weak"" is one of the lines of the episode"
18,11snpzh_00019,"Nina pulling the ""All the information you need is in the card"" reverse uno card"
19,11snpzh_00020,The consent moment was so damned cute
20,11snpzh_00021,"""yeah my asshole is in heaps of trouble"""
21,11snpzh_00022,"For our non-Aussie audience, ute = utility vehicle = pickup truck"
22,11snpzh_00023,Danielle is amazing every single episode
23,11snpzh_00024,"once in a lifetime ""The Notebook"" starring Luke & Lesser Tom"
24,11snpzh_00025,I thought you surrended because you were weak. Quote of the episode right there.
25,11snpzh_00026,I've managed to find an episode of this to watch and have to say Nina's pizza throw to fake Tom was something else! What a hidden talent that is.
26,11snpzh_00027,"It might be recency bias (I literally just finished it), but I think this might be the episode of Taskmaster that has made me laugh the most, the loudest, and the most consistently from any series? (I've watched all of UK, NZ, AU, and CA, and random other eps from other series here and there) There's no major moments that stand out like the UK series tends to get, but it's just the consistent, non-stop, unpredictable silliness of it all, at all levels. There's just so much going on in the details that are so fucking funny. From the moment the bad improv group popped their heads into the lab I was basically laughing non-stop. I can't think of another episode ever that is this densely packed with silly nonsense! Maybe I'm just tired. Edit: Turns out, I was going through pretty severe substance withdrawal symptoms at the time, and I was probably slightly delirious when watching the episode... Hey, it's a good one anyway!"
27,11snpzh_00028,"‘Oh, I thought you surrendered early because you’re WEAK!’"
28,11snpzh_00029,JIMMY NO! THE POINT OF THE TASK IS THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ONLY DO IT ONCE! YOU'LL GET DISQUALIFIED! JIMMY!!!
29,11snpzh_00030,I love it when the teams get names. I love the Bad Improv Group.
30,11snpzh_00031,So impressed with the climactic high five
31,11snpzh_00032,"""You've got to facilitate the birth of Ute Man"" is a sentence no one has ever said before and will never say again. ."
32,11snpzh_00033,How many times has Jimmy jumped into the boat like that this season?
33,11snpzh_00034,
34,11snpzh_00035,"I liked how after Greater Tom told Luke the bum mask looked like his real face, there was a momentary expression of ""maybe that was too far""."
35,11snpzh_00036,"i love nina she’s a treat she breaks your heart my fav type of low scorer. i’m also enjoying aus a bit more than nz, big tom is just so much better than jeremy wells it’s whack"
36,11snpzh_00037,"This team task is such a clever, simple idea that I wish they’d done it as an individual task so that we would get to see five interpretations of it."
37,11snpzh_00038,“Shut up son make me proud!” “That’s a bit harsh...”
38,11snpzh_00039,"I feel like Tom and Danielle will be best friends after this show, lol"
39,11snpzh_00040,Julia just channelling that Jo Brand energy.
40,11snpzh_00041,omg the gingernut has to be the winner doesnt it?
41,11snpzh_00042,Rotate the biscuits!!
42,11snpzh_00043,"A cut moment from this episode - Nina and Tom c talked about their bet again (I don't remember if it was post pizza or once off thing task) and he offered a reduction in the $ amount based on how she was doing so far in the season, but she stuck to her guns that she'll win and upheld the bet as is"
43,11snpzh_00044,Taskmaster proudly sponsored by the Mitsubishi ute which can’t brake well and comes with everything you need for the perfect pool party.
44,11snpzh_00045,"I replayed Nina flinging the pizza at Buongiorno so many times, it curled through the air and hit him dead on."
45,11snpzh_00046,Impressive pizza slice throw by Nina. I could see that working as a live task.
46,11snpzh_00047,"Danielle has a direct line to Lesser Tom’s funny bone. Also between the gimp suit and line about the weakness of surrender and her overly exuberant “BOOMs” in the other episode, she seems like she has a dark side."
47,11snpzh_00048,Awwww Luke and lesser Tom have the cutest little friendship.
48,11snpzh_00049,"Nina. Oh Nina. Just… Nina. At least she’s having fun. But, Nina."
49,11snpzh_00050,They have better imposter identification skills 🥸 than Mark Watson. 😂
50,11snpzh_00051,"I love how both teams immediately went to making Tom's dreams come true. I would as well, he's adorable"
51,11snpzh_00052,"Oh that's funny, nice to see some consequences for them not doing the dance"
52,11snpzh_00053,"I'm not seeing things, those are ducks right? Not geese."
53,11snpzh_00054,"""What's that thing called? A shed."" Oh, Nina..."
54,11snpzh_00055,"""Help! My ass!"""
55,11snpzh_00056,I want these contestants forever.
56,11snpzh_00057,I feel like Danielle could have easily kept dunking her disintegrated biscuit and bait Jimmy to keep dunking. I feel like he only stopped because he was the last one standing.
57,11snpzh_00058,This was the episode I went to and it was so good. I'll try to provide extra details after the episode.
58,11snpzh_00059,"The Bad Improve Group never fail to make me laugh, love this crew!"
59,11snpzh_00060,"Nina, you're in New Zealand. It's pronounced 'shid.'"
60,11snpzh_00061,I literally yelled when the Scotch Finger broke
61,11snpzh_00062,"wait, so if julia and danielle lose points for not doing the dance, that means the dance DOES matter! also, nina's attempt at the pizza task absolutely broke me. her throwing the pizza at italian tom was a great moment, but when she walked up the stairs and saw the real tom, my entire family couldn't stop laughing. her throwing the slice of pizza to him and it sliding off the table was funny too."
62,11snpzh_00063,"Ah yes, the old plague doctor gimp suit"
63,11snpzh_00064,Ute-Man's greatest weakness are rule technicalities
64,11snpzh_00065,Luke will only jump in the lake once because it’ll kill him
65,11snpzh_00066,not the sewage lake
66,11snpzh_00067,"Ahh, the old “what is a step?” conundrum. Classic Taskmaster."
67,11snpzh_00068,"How did Nina effectively give up half way through, and still have half the steps of Luke/Julia?"
68,11snpzh_00069,"I can hear my loud and eccentric laughter in the background, and my housemate is laughing at it."
69,11snpzh_00070,Julia just walking around - completely broken hahaha
70,11snpzh_00071,step step “...One!” Oh Nina...
71,11snpzh_00072,"""I need a costume, I think"" that's classic Jimmy"
72,11snpzh_00073,"""Yeah I'll do it again for ya!"" You fucked that one up Jimmy."
73,11snpzh_00074,Episode 7 - aka Tom's dream day out
74,11snpzh_00075,The next task is my fave of the 2 recordings i went to
75,11snpzh_00076,Thought someone would bring a BBQ!
76,11snpzh_00077,6 points! A Taskmaster first!
77,11snpzh_00078,"Get ready for it... Oh, Nina."
78,11snpzh_00079,"Geese from nowhere, just to mess with Tom."
79,11snpzh_00080,Bad Improv Group actually surprised me with how well they did
80,11snpzh_00081,"""What about driving carefully in a circle?"""
81,11snpzh_00082,"Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was..."
82,11snpzh_00083,This task is reminiscent of the one from Taskmaster UK Series 3.
83,11snpzh_00084,"""That's a... little truck... Tricycle... Boat... Friend... Pizza!"""
84,11snpzh_00085,Great now I want a taskmaster envelope made of chocolate 😂
85,11snpzh_00086,YES JULIA DOEYS!
86,11snpzh_00087,"I just cry laughed ""Oh, Nina!""."
87,11snpzh_00088,Holy shit this is a good task
88,11snpzh_00089,It’s weird seeing an assistant do a task
89,11snpzh_00090,"Ah, the sewage lake"
90,11snpzh_00091,They're taking so many steps.
91,11snpzh_00092,omg Nina!
92,11snpzh_00093,"Shit, that's a good prize task idea."
93,11snpzh_00094,"Oh no, they forgot to do the Macarena!"
94,11snpzh_00095,Oh Luke don’t do it!
95,11snpzh_00096,I was in tears watching this in the studio.
96,11snpzh_00097,...That's almost tea duelling Something I haven't thought about since like my first year of undergrad
97,11snpzh_00098,Jigsaw falling into place vibes
98,11snpzh_00099,Dammit. Now I want a pizza.
99,11snpzh_00100,"Nina, no!!!!!!"
100,11snpzh_00101,Sweet Jesus Danielle
101,11snpzh_00102,It looks like the channel have upped their regional locking and I am unable to get in via a VPN today :(
102,11snpzh_00103,This is a really cool idea for a team task.
103,11snpzh_00104,"Oh this is very good, quite something considering it's the Bad Improv Group"
104,11snpzh_00105,Of course it's not Tom!
105,11snpzh_00106,"Oh man, poor Nina"
106,11snpzh_00107,Why’d he bite it??
107,11snpzh_00108,wow
108,11snpzh_00109,
109,11snpzh_00110,Oh that looks fucking foul
110,11snpzh_00111,"So, turns out I switched the telly to 10 HD too early as I instead saw Albo being interviewed. The only reasonable thing to do now is to mute the TV until I see Nina shushing Lesser Tom. Also, super shattered I forgot to submit my TMAU questions to the AMA. Oh! They just played a TMAU ad."
111,11snpzh_00112,Anyone know who's winning overall so far?
112,11snpzh_00113,Does anyone know where Julia’s glittery green dress is from? I just love it 😍
113,11snpzh_00114,"Geez, Lesser Tom... That was oddly specific!"
114,11snpzh_00115,
115,11snpzh_00116,
116,11snpzh_00117,
117,11snpzh_00118,
118,11snpzh_00119,Probably the weakest episode of the season for me so far? Not a slight - Mainly because the rest have been exceptional
119,11snpzh_00120,
0,11zd78l_00001,"Was thinking ""Oh, they put Nina and Danielle together, that means Nina nailed this task as well?"" I was wrong. 😅"
1,11zd78l_00002,Not the biggest fan of the final task- I would've preferred more materials/time seeing as some of the ending results were very minimalistic in their transformations. Still one hell of a good episode though!
2,11zd78l_00003,"Taskmaster Australia may genuinly be one of the if not THE best offshoots imo. Tom as the Taskmaster is GREAT! He loves teasing the contestants, takes no sh*** from anyone, always explains his reasoning but does his own thing so he doesn't feel like someone just trying to be Greg. 'Lesser' Tom is a really good assistant with a fitting dry sense of humor and his very own dynamic with the Taskmaster. The Tasks are some of the best I've seen (including main series). The monster drawing studio task was A+ for example. So was 'do something you have never done and will never do again!'. And the Cast is varied, there to play and have good chemistry. Taskmaster AU for me just smashing it out of the Park from the get go 💕"
3,11zd78l_00004,"The guitar and drums in Nina's song really reminded me of something , annoyingly I can't think what but it's definitely been on my Spotify 😂"
4,11zd78l_00005,"Julia Morris constantly surprises me. Initially, it seemed like she'd be another Jo Brand-like contestant of trying to find the simplest, laziest and most direct way of doing the task. (Although she does let Danielle do all all the work in the team tasks). However, when she makes a horrible decision, she has Ed Gamble-like perseverance to follow through no matter how long it takes. There's been so many times she's taken so long to complete the task, but still manages to score some points (especially when others get disqualified). If Jo Brand had to spell antidisestablishmentarism, i reckon she would have given up. I'm still #TeamNina though, but man we've such a perfect cast for AU Season 1. Following seasons have a high bar to match."
5,11zd78l_00006,"So, just on the prize task, isn't this a case of a generational language gap? Tom is going by the dictionary definition of ""cursed"", whereas Nina (at very least) is going by the internet usage, which is more sort of ""What the fuck did I just see?""."
6,11zd78l_00007,Is Jimmy's final score the lowest of the series?
7,11zd78l_00008,"After this ep, I’m pretty sure Danielle is out of the running and Julia is going to walk away with it."
8,11zd78l_00009,"""Nina spent four and and half minutes showing me how cute different buttons are"". That's the Nina we know and love."
9,11zd78l_00010,"OMG, Lesser Tom is so mean! Making Nina talk to the camera like that!"
10,11zd78l_00011,i feel like it was necessary to show this sub what notification popped up as i was watching julia
11,11zd78l_00012,"This episode really just reinforced for me that I love Tom Cashman's style as the assistant. Goading Nina into bragging at the camera after the painting and the comment to Jimmy in the live task. You occasionally see that from Alex (e.g. to Iain Sterling in the ""find the pink ladies"" task), but Tom is constantly doing it and it's very funny. Shame Luke couldn't take home an episode that was ripe for the taking for him, but I'm really liking Julia so I'm happy to see her push out in front. I think every member of the cast is great, it's pretty cool to see that AU has done such a great casting job right off the bat. NZ1 had a strange energy because the grouping had a weird vibe even though the individuals were all good, so for AU1 to be so strong is a great sign going forward."
12,11zd78l_00013,I'm never one to complain about scoring but wtf was that scoring on the music task?
13,11zd78l_00014,"""That is undoubtedly the easiest suitcase"". I love Lesser Tom."
14,11zd78l_00015,I think perhaps they should have given them a little more time for this live task.
15,11zd78l_00016,I don't think Tom gets what cursed (as in horrific) means
16,11zd78l_00017,“I used to be in a recorder quartet…until they kicked me out.” That is pure poetry. Hemingway couldn’t write prose that good.
17,11zd78l_00018,“I’ve never actually wanted to kill myself before” a new all time quote from Julia
18,11zd78l_00019,"Danielle was robbed Edit: I mean, Julia deserved to win, but Danielle should have come second"
19,11zd78l_00020,Lesser Tom is sooooo evil!!!
20,11zd78l_00021,"Came here to mainly talk about greater Tom. I love him as the Taskmaster. He’s very witty and acerbic, his interactions with the crowd and the contestants are consistently some of the funniest parts of the show. He was excellent in this episode particularly. The dumb in unison quip totally saved a middling task and the booing from the crowd that did nothing, his look into the camera was perfect. He plays the role brilliantly and clearly shows how much a good Taskmaster adds to the charm of the show. And as any viewer of TM who has the time to come to this sub and write a whole paragraph I have to complain about the scoring of the musical task. Julia’s was clearly the worst, her win shocked me. I loved Danielle’s. Her scoring was egregious to my ears. Luke’s Tasmanian tiger got a big laugh out of me and so did Tom G’s extinction comment. Antiestablishmentarianism is a word and Julia’s execution of that task was top notch, her choice of colour too. She’s so good when she’s good and still good when she’s terrible."
21,11zd78l_00022,I absolutely loved Danielle working hard at her painting while Tom's looking at the blank canvas saying it looks a bit minimalist
22,11zd78l_00023,I'd have to disagree with Greater Tom; painting Australia on the canvas drop sheet seems like a perfectly valid interpretation of the wording of the task. #JusticeForDanielleAndNina
23,11zd78l_00024,Standing ovation for Julia for spelling her word correctly. That sounds really patronising but I really am impressed.
24,11zd78l_00025,Is Nina going to set a record for the most number of times failing to complete the task?
25,11zd78l_00026,Nina and Danielle on the painting task = Aisling cutting the bread in the caravan
26,11zd78l_00027,"I love the three women on this series. Julia has intentionally made me laugh more than just about any other contestant. Danielle’s life stories continually amaze me. And Nina is a constant delight, both with her attitude and style. I’m going to miss them all when the series ends."
27,11zd78l_00028,Please someone connect Lesser Tom with Paul Williams so he can finally have his musical episode
28,11zd78l_00029,"I struggled with Luke's song, I couldn't understand half of what he was saying"
29,11zd78l_00030,"I can now see how Julia is the favorite to win, because she puts everything into her tasks. Even ""Antidisestablishmentarianism,"" which she was doomed to fail, but it was funny to watch her slowly lose her mind. ""Can I just say...I've never wanted to kill myself before..."" Best possible response to doing a frustrating task. What's the deal with all the Taskmaster assistants being competent musicians? Anyway, for the celebratory personal theme tunes, it's too bad ""It's me Fern Brady"" didn't qualify. Although Danielle's ""I've got the voice of an angel, and the ass of a demon"" should have won. What an absolute travesty it only got two points. ""Smooth like a marble, but soft like a ba—no, not a baby dolphin."" For the canvas task, I feel like Nina and Danielle could have jointly argued the point about the canvas being beneath them and painting from the balcony, but Tom seems immovable on his decisions. Loved Luke proudly proclaiming ""I am the Tasmanian tiger"" with the striped post-it notes on his face. So triumphant. I know I say it every week, but I'm in love with Nina Oyama. This is how I feel every time Tom Gleeson puts her down:"
30,11zd78l_00031,Also lol Tom totally egged Nina on with those buttons
31,11zd78l_00032,OHH I TOTALLY FORGOT TO SAY TASKMASTER TOTALLY DIDN'T KNOW THE MODERN DEFINITION OF CURSED
32,11zd78l_00033,"I’ve never seen a task I’m so sure I would have failed so abysmally as that first task. As a colourblind person whose favourite word is “floccinaucinihilipilification”, I would have been trying to make a word I can’t spell with a colour I can’t see."
33,11zd78l_00034,Dumb in Unison is an amazing title
34,11zd78l_00035,I bloody love Nina's energy.
35,11zd78l_00036,"I didn't expect the recorder solo, and I'm amazed by it"
36,11zd78l_00037,Thigh slappin' Country Western Julia was not a combo I thought I'd see tonight
37,11zd78l_00038,Anyone here that was at the taping of this episode? I would love to know what Julia said that was bleeped.
38,11zd78l_00039,Luke has received 3 5 point scores this episode and is still coming in last in the overall standings.
39,11zd78l_00040,Lesser Tom was very sassy this episode and I loved every second of it!
40,11zd78l_00041,Tom totally gave Luke five points in the prize task just to mess with Danielle.
41,11zd78l_00042,"Okay, these two completely missing the task is the highlight of the episode"
42,11zd78l_00043,nina is so delightfully charming
43,11zd78l_00044,"My instant impression was that Julia is being scored too generously, but it’s mostly from the difficult-to-score music task. Her affirmation that she’s happier being single is a good message, and it was fun, but Danielle’s was the best. I would have gone Danielle, Nina, Julia, Luke, Jimmy, though I kinda like to see the winner not be chosen by the strength of the edit. I also thought the dumb in unison pair’s attempts should have counted because of the task wording, which means Julia would have likely gotten 2 points to Danielle’s 4 or 5. But kudos to her for trying so hard on that legendary 1st VT, with the hard color and long word. Also the irony of her cursed engagement ring. Not an Australian, I’m not sure how I would score the stage task, though it’s clear Julia did the most work."
44,11zd78l_00045,"Ahahaha, Danielle's outrage at 5 points being given out just for a joke 😂"
45,11zd78l_00046,Anyone else think Antidisestablishmentarianism should of been the episode's title?
46,11zd78l_00047,"Can't believe we're so close to the end already, absolutely stellar first season so far"
47,11zd78l_00048,Like watching Kate Bush in her prime
48,11zd78l_00049,"Probably the weakest episode to be honest - music task was hit and miss (couldn't really understand Luke there), and the spelling in a colour one wasn't the best one either. Live Task went by a little too fast for my liking. That being said, the paint Australia one was funny even before you have Danielle and Nina completely missing the point. Hilarious task!"
49,11zd78l_00050,"When Julia said Antidisestablishmentarianism, I instantly knew why she was being shown last."
50,11zd78l_00051,Nina just eating handfuls of spaghetti 😆
51,11zd78l_00052,"Things like the ""Paint Australia"" task are enjoyable but they feel kind of like a missed opportunity sometimes because no one can really succeed at it and everyone pretty much fails in the same way"
52,11zd78l_00053,Danielle really continuing the cursed energy of this episode
53,11zd78l_00054,I'm amazed at how musically diverse this group is
54,11zd78l_00055,Oh wow I didn't realize Danielle had caught up so much
55,11zd78l_00056,Julia is amazing.
56,11zd78l_00057,God I love Julia
57,11zd78l_00058,Oh god the autotune is struggling
58,11zd78l_00059,If Luke doesn’t win an episode I may cry
59,11zd78l_00060,"Luke's song was my favourite even though that's mostly because of Cashman. I would have chosen antidisestablishmentarianism too, I was thinking that before Julia even said it. Chose it as a spelling word in like year 4 because I'm a prick like that. Danielle and Nina definitely had a point in regards to the paintings. The task wasn't worded well enough. Absolutely my favourite episode yet. I was losing it during Julia's spelling attempt."
60,11zd78l_00061,Shhhhh! Nina Oyama saying that at the start of each Taskmaster episode feels like it's being said directly at the Project.
61,11zd78l_00062,"I think a lot of people think Danielle and Nina's attempts at the painting task should've counted, but if you look at the wording of the task, one thing that wasn't even mentioned in the argument is that the task said something about the canvas having to stay on the ground, so if you consider the sheet on the balcony 'the canvas', then it was off the ground and they would be disqualified."
62,11zd78l_00063,What did Julia morris say just after the music task that got blanked out?
63,11zd78l_00064,Surprised Luke got scored as highly as he did. I really liked Nina's and thought she should have gotten second.
64,11zd78l_00065,"😳 I just asked (Australian) Google to spell 'palaver' (in a blatantly Aussie accent) and she said, ""P-A-L-A-V-A""... She then offered to define 'palava'. At the bottom of the very long definition and explanation of origins, it showed that it was the definition of 'palaver'."
65,11zd78l_00066,My God! Danielle pulled up a handful of razor sharp New Zealand grass! How are her hands not a bloody mess !
66,11zd78l_00067,"Only two eps left, that saddens me"
67,11zd78l_00068,Tom with the Smells like teen spirit riff?
68,11zd78l_00069,What did Julia morris say that got bleeped out? hahaha
69,11zd78l_00070,Nina with another energetic entrance
70,11zd78l_00071,Could you just pour a bunch of paint down and then do what Jimmy did with the oar but actually going down to draw on the canvas.
71,11zd78l_00072,"That was a very hard task, lol"
72,11zd78l_00073,Antidisestablishmentarianism and green grass would have been my choice! Luke’s song is the only one remaining in my head. I thought Julia was making the Sydney Opera House with watermelon. Was hoping Luke would finally win an episode. I’ve got to apologise to Nina for expecting her to stay in last place throughout the series and the same to Julia for leading. Bracing myself for that tantrum looking task next week.
73,11zd78l_00074,"QLD Checking in. Missed Prize Task, and just caught the end of Task 1, Danielle & Julia. Julia's word was nuts! Yet another task that sent her to near breakdown 😂😂 But bloody good on her! Loved how quick Danielle was. Very bish bash bosh."
74,11zd78l_00075,"Haven’t seen it yet, but I’ll eat my hat if the title (Dumb in Unison) is NOT a quote of someone describing the team of 3."
75,11zd78l_00076,"Haha, the girls can spell but the guys can't!!!"
76,11zd78l_00077,"Big points to whoever figures out what Julia said, lmao"
77,11zd78l_00078,I would've painted a mirror image of Australia on the real easel and carefully let it down to stamp it onto the canvas below.
78,11zd78l_00079,"anyone have a link or just a comment containing the current series scores? ETA the taskmaster wiki never lets me down, duh Danielle 125 Jimmy 117 Julia 127 Luke 105 Nina 106"
79,11zd78l_00080,Oh no Nina
80,11zd78l_00081,"I had to skip the music task, taking me back to Red Faces levels of vicarious embarrassment."
81,11zd78l_00082,Was Nina originally going for Rolf Harris in the final task? It looked more beard than banana?
82,11zd78l_00083,What did Julia say?????
83,11zd78l_00084,OK Danielle wins this one
0,126gpxx_00001,Julia Morris was easily the most contentious casting when TMAU was announced but she’s been an inspired choice. Having a contestant with reasonable profile throw themselves into tasks and embrace the silliness of the show is exactly what’s required as proof of concept for audiences
1,126gpxx_00002,Luke cancelling the compliments with insults was genius
2,126gpxx_00003,"Julia's killed it, she went full Rhod Gilbert there"
3,126gpxx_00004,"""None of this tantrum counts."""
4,126gpxx_00005,"Oh shit, have we got our own Fred the Swede?"
5,126gpxx_00006,"""I'll never support bucket equality"""
6,126gpxx_00007,JULIA NO NOT THE SPIT
7,126gpxx_00008,Jimmy deserved one for that photo task
8,126gpxx_00009,"I respect Julia's message but this isn't a tantrum, lol"
9,126gpxx_00010,"Luke, with a bucket on his head, declaring: ""You will die alone!"" My fave."
10,126gpxx_00011,"I think Jimmy and Nina should be easy leaders in tantrums, because none of the others really did the task. A choreographed fight scene isn't a tantrum, and neither is a song. I guess you could do a musical number about the singer having a tantrum, but this wasn't that. My idea was to find out what things I was allowed to destroy - I assume at a certain point they'd say no for budgetary reasons - and then gather that stuff, and scream and smash everything in sight. Throw it against the wall, hit it with the axe, whatever."
11,126gpxx_00012,"Shoutout to the team writing the tasks for this season, they’ve produced some exceptional ideas. In particular I think this season might have the strongest live tasks of any TM series."
12,126gpxx_00013,Nina telling knock knock jokes is peak Nina
13,126gpxx_00014,'So the drapes fell out naturally?' That line didn't get enough love in the studio
14,126gpxx_00015,"Things I can hopefully remember from the taping: We had Laura Danielle as our studio hypewoman which is probably why our crowd was so enthusiastic. She did a great job at getting us warmed up and signalling when to clap. She also did a lot of filler entertainment for when the stage was being set, getting people to answer questions, dance, and sing.....reluctantly. One man was very into singing Bohemian Rhapsody though, and we did have a little sing along. I think it was Danielle who initially said she would have brought in Cathy Freeman. Greater Tom managed to turn it very inappropriate very quickly by likening it to slavery/owning another human. Needless to say, that was quickly decided to not be aired. Danielle also had a much longer time trying to defend Nina's prize task. I wish they kept Julias full recounting of her stalking of Tom, she had to tell us not to clap at a certain point because she hadn't finished the story. I think it was while setting up for the final task but Greater Tom answered some studio audience questions. KH guy you will live forever in my memory. I will never get over my horror/revulsion with Julia with the ""Gather the items"" task. 10/10 for her commitment and I regret seeing it a second time."
15,126gpxx_00016,"Fuck, I know from TMNZ that the locker room means we've got something sketchy EDIT: Oh man, that's good."
16,126gpxx_00017,I'm living for this growing friendship between Luke and Lesser Tom.
17,126gpxx_00018,Nina not shaking hands with the doctor was very underrated!
18,126gpxx_00019,OMG Julia's such a stalker! 😱
19,126gpxx_00020,'... if comedians are smarter than doctors.' Is Mike Wozniak smarter than Mike Wozniak?
20,126gpxx_00021,"""Well, well, well, Mr. Shit!"" The poop theme continues."
21,126gpxx_00022,"Cashman with the biggest smile: ""all the information is on the task!"""
22,126gpxx_00023,JULIA KILLED IT
23,126gpxx_00024,"I’d never normally say this because I’m a stickler for the scoring system, but I’d have given Julia six points for that photo task. The effort, the distance, the money spent, it was brilliant. I don’t think anyone’s ever gone quite so above and beyond for a task, save of course Josh Widdicombe and his tattoo."
24,126gpxx_00025,You may not touch the doctor. You may not hurt the doctor.
25,126gpxx_00026,"As no one else has posted a thread yet, here you go! Mods feel free to delete if you make an official one"
26,126gpxx_00027,Just when you think Julia can't surprise you any more she pulls out the process of photosynthesis
27,126gpxx_00028,Tantrum = musical number in Julia's world. Sensational.
28,126gpxx_00029,So next episode Julia won't be allowed within 500m of Greater Tom.
29,126gpxx_00030,Musical theatre tantrum is not something I expected
30,126gpxx_00031,
31,126gpxx_00032,"""like... paw prints""? ""like the artist formerly known as"". If Nina had made Joel do the peepeepoopoo dance, she would have smashed that task. She also smashed a scarily believable tantrum and was absolutely robbed (again) on that. Unfocused? What? Losing to an audience-pandering musical number? I was pretty confident that Luke would be great, and he hasn't disappointed. And Danielle is just a wonderful disaster, oh boy. I'm still not a huge fan of Jimmy and Julia's usual schtick, but they've turned in some great performances on the show. Jimmy deserved 1 for the photoshop though."
32,126gpxx_00033,This was such a fun task
33,126gpxx_00034,can dr joel can be own frank the swede
34,126gpxx_00035,Julia fucking nails it.
35,126gpxx_00036,I love everything about Joel already
36,126gpxx_00037,"Initially I wasn't feeling Julia's tantrum, but yeah, that was sensational as fuck."
37,126gpxx_00038,Can-berra.
38,126gpxx_00039,"Wow, I'm falling behind on all my Taskmasters (this one wasn't even pinned anymore). I suppose that's not a bad place to be. This was one of my favorite episodes of the season. Make Dr. Joel look like a fool was classic TM. ""This is crazy."" I liked Nina's Valley Girl accent. Danielle mocking the doctor for not knowing carnivorous plants was a riot. ""Never heard of a frickin' sundew, dude?"" But Luka and Nina jointly humiliating the doctor was comedy gold: ""Knock knock."" ""Who's there?"" ""I did up."" ""I did up who?"" ""Ew, you did a poo? Gross!"" ""Sir, would you get that shoe off your head, please? We're at a funeral."" ""Yummy poopy in my tummy tummy!"" Just utterly ridiculous. God, I love that woman. The tantrum task was similarly so much fun. Danielle throwing a real tantrum and axing the fake Tom was on point. The bucket task seemed pretty boring until Julia and Luke got in there. Julia eating her own spit and Luke insulting the bucket (to cancel out the compliments) was a masterstroke. The secret photo of the Taskmaster was so damn fun. Julia nailed it completely and stalked him for a whole day. I'm just going to say it, she deserves to win the series. Jimmy getting 4 points for his Photoshopped effort was fucking bullshit, though. Luke deserved that 4 points for a great bush shot. The trampoline/step task was probably the weakest part of the episode. But still overall a great showing. Gratuitous pic of Nina just because"
39,126gpxx_00040,"Ask Joel medical questions since his 'Dr' title is a PhD, not an MD."
40,126gpxx_00041,JULIA IS ALL IN
41,126gpxx_00042,"Another awesome episode. The extra task was amazing. Julia (and Luke's) attempt really reminded me of early UK seasons, when Greg D had long connections with certain participants."
42,126gpxx_00043,"Luke was robbed again. Had he been given a few more points in the photo section and Jimmy not been given 4 (WTF was that, Tom? He totally didn't even do the task!) then Luke could have won this episode. Why does Tom seem to hate him so much?"
43,126gpxx_00044,Why did Tom have 13 minutes on his timer for the photo task? There's a bit of a 13 theme this episode.
44,126gpxx_00045,Oh this is one of the best task efforts ever
45,126gpxx_00046,Julia just this side of Rhod Gilbert in the wardrobe levels of stalking.
46,126gpxx_00047,"Haha, I was waiting for someone to bring in runners!"
47,126gpxx_00048,It is always fun when Julia is last.
48,126gpxx_00049,Hide in the Taskmaster's wardrobe Rhod Gilbert-style!
49,126gpxx_00050,"Wow, Julia's finale outfit is stunning. Looks like a winner's outfit, but we'll see..."
50,126gpxx_00051,I live in Minnesota and this is such an odd place to see another Minnesotan lol
51,126gpxx_00052,"Nina's last to make the doctor a fool, so she's done something interesting. I hope she's come up with a clever and creative solution that will get her five points, but based on past history, she's probably fucked it. EDIT: Wait, I forgot Luke!"
52,126gpxx_00053,"Oh no the second hand embarrassment, its kicking in"
53,126gpxx_00054,Minnesota JOEL
54,126gpxx_00055,"Julia, you queen."
55,126gpxx_00056,Next week's episode will be at a later timeslot?! Does that mean it will be uncensored?
56,126gpxx_00057,"The doctor is from Minnesota? If he's a Vikings fan, making him look like a fool would be pretty easy."
57,126gpxx_00058,WE'RE ONLY 25 MINUTES INTO THE SHOW!!! HOW DARE THEY SHOW YET ANOTHER AD BREAK!!! HOW MANY ******* AD BREAKS DO THEY NEED!?!?!?
58,126gpxx_00059,Poor Danielle!
59,126gpxx_00060,oh that twist is so fucking good
60,126gpxx_00061,Omg Tom and Luke car pool.
61,126gpxx_00062,Has any other taskmaster episode had an extra task like this one?? (not including tiebreakers)
62,126gpxx_00063,"Julia in the bucket task made me gag, I deeply admire her commitment"
63,126gpxx_00064,"Complaining about past tasks in detail would have made for a good tantrum. It would have been better if they could have done them at the locations of those tasks, but they didn't have time to do that. Julia's efforts in the Photo task was just epic. If I could have awarded it 10 points I would have. The bucket task was chaotic. I would have been tempted to write letters on paper and put them into the buckets. One A, two Bs, three Cs, etc. If they try doing an American Taskmaster again, I nominate Dr. Joel as the Assistant."
64,126gpxx_00065,Very strong prize task so far!
65,126gpxx_00066,"As someone with IBS, I relate to Nina's prize so much."
66,126gpxx_00067,Has anyone else ever heard this photosynthesis song? Or is it from olden times
67,126gpxx_00068,Holy fuck no
68,126gpxx_00069,You know what this show lacks? Ad breaks.
69,126gpxx_00070,I don't know if it was intentional but Julia's tantrum worked on a whole other level as women are expected to grin and bear it and she threw her tantrum while smiling and singing
70,126gpxx_00071,This is a genius task idea
71,126gpxx_00072,Love how into it Lesser Tom is. It's so much fun.
72,126gpxx_00073,oh no danielle
73,126gpxx_00074,Yes!! Love a two parter
74,126gpxx_00075,"Best task of the season, calling it now"
75,126gpxx_00076,"If you make the Doctor look like a fool, won't that 'hurt' his feeling and fail the task?. 😅"
76,126gpxx_00077,ITS ONIONS AGAIN!
77,126gpxx_00078,Easily one of the best tasks!!
78,126gpxx_00079,"I like that AUS and NZ have tasks that resolve at the taping. NZ had the covert costumes in season 1 and the doppelgängers in season 3, and now the paparazzi task."
79,126gpxx_00080,"I think Luke's got this one, guys"
80,126gpxx_00081,"If this is all a setup, I swear to god"
81,126gpxx_00082,"Oh god, what's Julia done to him?"
82,126gpxx_00083,"Oh hell yes, it's one of these prize tasks!"
83,126gpxx_00084,"Aw man, a later timeslot for the finale next week? Ah well. Can't believe the finale's here next week, that's gone by real fast."
84,126gpxx_00085,The first portion before the ad break felt very rushed particularly the prize round.
85,126gpxx_00086,"Does anyone remember touching someone with another object is generally found to break the ""no touching,"" rule? I was thinking you could get a texta and draw penises and boobs on the doctor's cheeks and forehead, but it might not be worth the risk. I guess you could ask Lesser Tom to do it, or give the doctor the texta, hold up a mirror or a phone with the camera pointed at him, and ask him to do it to himself."
86,126gpxx_00087,"Did anyone else get a very confusing Tenplay ad which just showed a bunch of people setting tables, making beds, putting rosemary in water, cooking etc? Edit: I clicked the ad and it’s for Harris Scarfe, the shittest department store, so that makes sense"
87,126gpxx_00088,"A very enjoyable episode with hilarious tasks. Well, apart from genuinely ratching at Julia's buckett attempt."
88,126gpxx_00089,"Do people from Minnesota really pronounce ""margarine"" like that?"
89,126gpxx_00090,Danielle finally got her chance to use the axe!
90,126gpxx_00091,I'm glad that Nina decided to not do a number 2 in the number 2 bucket. The second task would have been very uncomfortable.
91,126gpxx_00092,With the exception of Julia’s stalking and Luke’s bucket insults this was the worst episode of the global franchise
92,126gpxx_00093,The tasks on this series are so good.
93,126gpxx_00094,Real poop theme going on tonight.
94,126gpxx_00095,"Guys, is the the episode where Nina finally wins?"
95,126gpxx_00096,oh Danielle's tantrum's going to be good
96,126gpxx_00097,"If taskmaster is later next week, does that mean it will be uncensored?"
97,126gpxx_00098,"""taskmaster finally on at the later time..."" NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! This is why I don't watch TV! you are forever changing the schedule of shows! Sorry my Australian TV bugbear right there, in the ad break!"
98,126gpxx_00099,Luke and the bucket insults had me rolling! I love him!
99,126gpxx_00100,"I think they missed a trick on the tantrum task by giving julia 5 points, it should have got to the 5 points and then gone, 'julia 3 points' and then given her 2 other points for something random to make it actually 5 points"
100,126gpxx_00101,She's no Lisa Lampanelli!! (Thank goodness!)

12,126o4tf_00013,“why would you do that to me? why would anybody do that?” i just love her
13,126o4tf_00014,That flicker of cheekiness across Kiell’s face when he realised he hadn’t said Alex’s name… I think he’s my favourite already!

18,126o4tf_00019,Frankie Boyle dressed as a bride dancing to silent disco and snogging Alex Horne feels like a fever dream
19,126o4tf_00020,Ivo is already getting absolutely rinsed. I am sensing the Katherine Parkinson vibes already.
20,126o4tf_00021,“i genuinely felt like the lord was involved” MAE
21,126o4tf_00022,Ivo showing that he absolutely drove the Ever Given down the Suez
22,126o4tf_00023,"I am still absolutely stunned by the fact that Frankie ""The Hatred Of Daily Mail Readers Nourishes Me"" Boyle is going on Taskmaster. I think many of us grew up with him making fairly regular appearances on the front pages of the newspapers for saying many, many startling and uncommonly outrageous things. SO to have him on cheerful, uncomplicated Taskmaster is hilarious, but it is very unexpected. (Though I'll bet Jenny Eclair can out-swear him, the older ladies who come on Taskmaster must never be underestimated)"
23,126o4tf_00024,KIEL’S FACE WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING 1 POINT
24,126o4tf_00025,ah love a task where alex is genuinely fearing for his life

33,126o4tf_00034,"Interesting random fact: Jenny Eclair was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Ivo Graham was born in Tokyo, Japan."
34,126o4tf_00035,Ivo falling off the chair was perfection. 🤣
35,126o4tf_00036,I never would’ve expected Ivo to be the saboteur
36,126o4tf_00037,"Observations so far: Mae is just fabulous, I am mesmerised and just want to hug them Frankie is going to say some awful things in that soft voice Kiell does not play a character in ghosts, Mike is just Kiell 😆"
37,126o4tf_00038,"IVO you idiot, if you’d waited for Kiell to throw you’d be rolling in the points"
38,126o4tf_00039,The contrast between Mae's calm focus and Ivo's kid-on-a-Haribo-rush energy 😂
39,126o4tf_00040,Kiell the easy winner of outfit of the series.

41,126o4tf_00042,"""Yo"" and Scottish rudeness are the ultimate tag team in this task."

43,126o4tf_00044,“You can’t just hide bits of the task” Has Frankie never seen the show before?
44,126o4tf_00045,🎶 Taskmaster's on! It is on now! 🎶
45,126o4tf_00046,Go on then... who's gonna upload the dances with the right music?
46,126o4tf_00047,I do appreciate that the buckets were adjusted by height to the contestants. Somewhere Sian Gibson is vindicated.
47,126o4tf_00048,"Guys, it’s back. We survived. We did it. Well done."
48,126o4tf_00049,Thought that was cotton eyed Joe lol

56,126o4tf_00057,"One wonders what the people who own those lovely houses overlooking the canal made of Jenny Eclair in a sailors hat squalling BRACE BRACE, and crashing a barge in a quite stunning display of Health and Safety breaches."
57,126o4tf_00058,"Ted Lasso, Succession, and Taskmaster all being on in the same week is going to save my mental health."
58,126o4tf_00059,It’s the little quips like “are you alright” that I’ve missed the most 🤣 peak humour for me
59,126o4tf_00060,I’m astonished health & safety signed off on this task
60,126o4tf_00061,Think of all the money they are saving on music licencing
61,126o4tf_00062,Acaster would have killed this task
62,126o4tf_00063,For meeeeee
63,126o4tf_00064,🎶 For me 🎶
64,126o4tf_00065,he broke the steering thing. maybe he went after jenny 💀

67,126o4tf_00068,"Wait what, is it tonight? This says otherwise"
68,126o4tf_00069,I feel like the line between Stand-up Greg and Taskmaster Greg is beginning to blur a bit. He seems less confrontational and more engaged with the contestants.
69,126o4tf_00070,"Glad we’ve already established the whipping boy of this series, poor ivo 😅"
70,126o4tf_00071,That throw from Ivo to take out the bucket was quality! So much power for that accuracy
71,126o4tf_00072,James Acaster would've crushed this task
72,126o4tf_00073,Does Ever Given mean anything to anyone here?
73,126o4tf_00074,They've gone feral.
74,126o4tf_00075,"Incredible live task. An excellent start to this season. Kiell was the one I knew least about going in, but fairly sure he's gonna be a favourite."
75,126o4tf_00076,IVO THE TRAITOR
76,126o4tf_00077,"Gotta be honest, at the start of the episode I wasn't feeling it - the dancing task fell flat for me, and I was starting to worry that this might literally be the first episode I didn't enjoy. But I was wrong to doubt it. As soon as they revealed that Frankie's time was six months (and counting) Taskmaster was back. Then the barge task was amazing. And wrapping it up with the sudden, unexpected betrayal of Ivo and Kiell destroying each other in the live task... marvelous."
77,126o4tf_00078,Someone stated here before the episode that Jenny is the one that could outswear Frankie. That was the easiest true prediction.
78,126o4tf_00079,“i watched it and felt it as well. i felt it was shit” 💀
79,126o4tf_00080,kiell is SO endearing man
80,126o4tf_00081,TM team really pushing the boat out for this series
81,126o4tf_00082,HOW MANY OF GREGS SIGN OFF ARE HIM TRYING TO SPLIT UP PARTNERS LMAOOO
82,126o4tf_00083,Omg Alex’s face after Jenny crashed
83,126o4tf_00084,"“SPIN, BITCH, SPIN.”"
84,126o4tf_00085,"For somebody who has never driven a barge before, he's done a damn good job."
85,126o4tf_00086,"God I love this show, and will never, ever, ever tire of it"
86,126o4tf_00087,"We called it! Proposals and stag dos, now it's the wedding!"
87,126o4tf_00088,The first viewing of the opening credits is always exciting as the total lack of context is at its purest. I like all the panel so I'm hoping for a very good 10 weeks.
88,126o4tf_00089,"13 minutes in, and we already have Frankie Boyle in drag. 10/10 so far!"
89,126o4tf_00090,Six months?! Fucking Hell Frankie. 🤣 🤣
90,126o4tf_00091,Ivo snatches defeat from the jaws of victory!
91,126o4tf_00092,FUCKING HELL IVO 😂
92,126o4tf_00093,"When Mae said ""nice to see you,"" Alex could have responded ""to see you nice"" but that would have been totally lost on them because they grew up in Canada."
93,126o4tf_00094,Who would have thought Frankie Boyle is just shit at everything? He might improve but I'm betting he comes dead last
94,126o4tf_00095,"“Once bread has become toast, it can never become bread again.” - Kiell the philosopher"
95,126o4tf_00096,The heavy breathing during this task is sending me I love it
96,126o4tf_00097,Frankie making it look like Alex has just married Liz Truss after a downward spiral of alcohol and snacks.

99,126o4tf_00100,Jenny Eclair has already become a broken shell of a woman. God help how she gets by the end of this. I absolutely love her!
100,126o4tf_00101,I am so charmed by Kiell already.
101,126o4tf_00102,Ivo recreating the Evergiven there
102,126o4tf_00103,FOR MEEEEEE
103,126o4tf_00104,for meeee is going to follow everything I say for at least a week now
104,126o4tf_00105,One hell of a task to start with. Silent disco wedding dance is a brilliant idea.
105,126o4tf_00106,AHOY HAT
106,126o4tf_00107,My serotonin is back bebeh
107,126o4tf_00108,"Sorry Mae, you're going on the crush list"
108,126o4tf_00109,Kiell ain’t here to make friends.
109,126o4tf_00110,Glad Frankie finally called Alex out for hiding information
110,126o4tf_00111,Secret Drawer getting an early appearance.
111,126o4tf_00112,"Damn, Kiell killed it"
112,126o4tf_00113,I love tasks where the contestants are much worse than the production crew ever anticipated. There's a magic to Alex's reactions.
113,126o4tf_00114,Ivo with the sabotage!
114,126o4tf_00115,"Devious tactics, I FUCKING LOVE IT."
115,126o4tf_00116,Nice that they went for different pole heights compared to similar tasks in earlier seasons.
116,126o4tf_00117,"Oh this is great! Love how you could literally see the dynamic between the contestants, Greg and Alex improve over the course of the episode. The barge and live tasks will probably show up in Taskmaster highlight reels for years to come. Only thing that was maybe slightly negative in my opinion was the choice of the first task (do the marriage dance with Alex), simply because some of the contestants didn’t manage to come up with unique performances and Mae had an emotional moment (which would likely have been more impactful later in the series, like Sarah Millican’s song in Series 14). Until now, the very first task was always one full of surprises where the personalities of all contestants were immediately able to shine."
117,126o4tf_00118,"I’m worried about Ivo, like, in general. You know how Rhod nearly killed Alex for a task? I feel like that’ll be Ivo except he’ll nearly kill or maim himself, not Alex. This was an A+ episode. I think Mae will sweep the series handily—it’ll be a piece of piss"
118,126o4tf_00119,Frankie really reminds me of Homer Simpson in a wedding dress
119,126o4tf_00120,I don’t love this string task tbh
120,126o4tf_00121,BRACE BRACE
121,126o4tf_00122,Gotta love it when they use one part of the task from the first few seconds of the intro. “I’m Bracing!!” is a key quote
122,126o4tf_00123,I'm loving Kiel's song.
123,126o4tf_00124,I was crying laughing at Jenny driving into the brick wall shouting brace brace. I love both Saturday Night and On a barge poll for me.
124,126o4tf_00125,If that's how Ivo gonna play I'm looking forward to the rest of the series
125,126o4tf_00126,Ivo is pretty sexy with that beard ngl
126,126o4tf_00127,"These are the vibes I’m getting from everyone. Frankie - Classic case of a father getting involved in a game of backyard cricket at a barbecue. Happy to be there and play along, but things won’t necessarily go his way. Ivo - A puppy who just wants to get out there and do everything, but is ultimately going to fall victim to the harsh realities of the world. Jenny - It’s like she’s leading a gang of ghosts around on an epic hen night, just going around fucking shit up like an 18 year old stuck in a 63 year old’s body. Kiell - Here for a good time, but is clearly trying to do well. The popular older brother to Ivo’s less popular younger brother in school, and the two, whilst obviously competing with everyone, shall feel like the competition is just between the two of them. Mae - It’s like a surgeon went to med school and walked away with a PHD in Taskmaster. Calm. Collected. Efficient. A jungle cat. Focused. The mind of a killer. They’ll do well, and like many of us have been saying, they’re going to win. I think it would be nice if Mae wins. That way we have 7 male champions, 7 female champions, with the decider being someone who is non-binary."
127,126o4tf_00128,"the face on Frankie when he walked around the corner dressed as a bride had me creased up immediately. Kiell is off to a flyer though. God, I'm glad we're back!!!"
128,126o4tf_00129,"Fuck me, this is worse than when Mel and Joe got docked 5 points for eating chocolate."
129,126o4tf_00130,"Imagine being Ozzy and playing a VR game, you'd probably think all those drugs are taking their toll"
130,126o4tf_00131,It came from the Lord 😂😂😂😂
131,126o4tf_00132,I didn't think I'd see Ivo Graham humping a barge in excitement tonight but here we are. 😂😂
132,126o4tf_00133,Aaaaand I've got a crush on Mae
133,126o4tf_00134,The fact that this isn’t the first time Alex has attempted The Worm on the show is brilliant
134,126o4tf_00135,Making it a silent disco is absolutely genius. How is this show still so good after 15 seasons
135,126o4tf_00136,The heavy breathing is wonderfully uncomfortable
136,126o4tf_00137,Genuine fear in Alex’s eyes
137,126o4tf_00138,What a twist!!
138,126o4tf_00139,I keep watching that throw from Ivo; unrivalled speed and accuracy tbf
139,126o4tf_00140,I’m still thinking about that HUGE bite Alex took out of the scotch apple 😭
140,126o4tf_00141,This is Hugh Dennis level choreography lol
141,126o4tf_00142,It's bad when you out-awkward LAH.
142,126o4tf_00143,"We’re halfway first the episode, but what a fucking cast, smashed it out the park again this is going to be such a good season. What a show"
143,126o4tf_00144,This feels like the most diverse line-up we’ve ever had. Hard to think of any other scenario you’d find these five people in the same room together.
144,126o4tf_00145,why would you do that to me?
145,126o4tf_00146,SPIN BITCH SPIN
146,126o4tf_00147,DRAMA
147,126o4tf_00148,"One point, no black pudding"
148,126o4tf_00149,So we don’t get to hear the music? I thought it would be the opposite way around (they couldn’t hear the music) but this is funnier.
149,126o4tf_00150,The fucking chair squeaks lmao
150,126o4tf_00151,Kearns Hat!
151,126o4tf_00152,Jenny almost killed Alex lol.
152,126o4tf_00153,Kiell was actually pretty good at that
153,126o4tf_00154,I wonder how many great outtakes frankie will provide
154,126o4tf_00155,The drama
155,126o4tf_00156,What a bad boy
156,126o4tf_00157,"Guys, I think I love Mae."
157,126o4tf_00158,Pulling that drawer and seeing the ball of string must be the greatest feeling in the world
158,126o4tf_00159,Kiell and Mae look like they are shitting themselves
159,126o4tf_00160,"If you're not shaking hands with your spouse at the end of your first dance, are you even married?"
160,126o4tf_00161,ivo is ADORABLE
161,126o4tf_00162,"There’s a small part of me every series that’s like, “oh god, maybe this is the one where the cast don’t work nor play off one another”, and then that’s immediately disproven within 5 minutes lol"
162,126o4tf_00163,Absolutely bosh'd it.
163,126o4tf_00164,Who knew Kiell would be the Max Verstappen of canal boat driving
164,126o4tf_00165,"Jeeez he quoted Meat Loaf, Ivo's my absolute fave"
165,126o4tf_00166,i love when the live task is failed by basically everyone
166,126o4tf_00167,It really was something out of the Eton playbook
167,126o4tf_00168,Oh I already know I'm gonna love Kiell throughout this series.
168,126o4tf_00169,"Brilliant episode with a brilliant cast Ivo's very funny and has a self-deprecating vibe that will hamper his success but makes him funny and entertaining. Frankie's very funny and also knows the perfect moment to chime in, he doesn't say something whenever he can, only when it would be funny to do so. Kiell's very entertaining and I think a benefit of him not being a comedian is it he isn't presenting a persona or pushing a brand, he's just himself. Jenny just looks like she's having fun, and I think every series needs somewhere there for a laugh who'll be happy to (similarly to Frankie) do whatever's needed to for a humour. The only contestant I don't love is Mae. They bring a certain type of awkwardness that I really grates me, they either are barely emotive or they just say something 'deep' for no reason. I don't hate them but they're not entertaining ar particularly funny."
169,126o4tf_00170,i know it’s a minor aspect of the show but i hate when people don’t try to do anything fun or interesting with their outfits so 4/5 of these make me sad
170,126o4tf_00171,THE AHOY CAP OMG
171,126o4tf_00172,"Ok, I wasn't 100% feeling the string task but this one has just brought it up to 100 for me"
172,126o4tf_00173,loving Kiel’s energy
173,126o4tf_00174,"I dunno why, but it felt kinda flat to me. The energy just felt off, and the audience seemed quiet."
174,126o4tf_00175,"Did anyone find the first 2 tasks a little… lazy? The dancing one was already done in series 4, this time without music (did that make the task better?). And then the yarn one with the second part of the task in the other side… it seemed more like a tie breaker than a real task. Maybe the problem is that this was the first episode, first 2 tasks, and those tasks felt lacking, compare it to the previous season first 2 tasks (guess the movies wearing the box in the head and the loo roll throw)"
175,126o4tf_00176,Frankie is already a delight
176,126o4tf_00177,“Once bread has become toast it can never be bread again” that’s going on my Taskmaster quotes list.
177,126o4tf_00178,The breathing 😂
178,126o4tf_00179,Oh no Jenny 🤣
179,126o4tf_00180,Ivo with an amazing heel turn.
180,126o4tf_00181,Over to Prictionary Corner
181,126o4tf_00182,I'm looking forward to this so much!
182,126o4tf_00183,TRENCH VAGINA
183,126o4tf_00184,Frankie with the Reece Shearsmith as Maureen vibes.
184,126o4tf_00185,Well I can't wait till some fine talented person manages to put the music to these.
185,126o4tf_00186,Anyone else getting Hugh Dennis’s ringtone dance task vibes here?
186,126o4tf_00187,"Jenny is just fantastic And so are Frankie, Ivo, Kiell and Mae. Theyre all just phenomenal"
187,126o4tf_00188,THE HAT!!
188,126o4tf_00189,No wonder Alex destroyed Jenny in the studio lol.
189,126o4tf_00190,"I'm actually crying, what a task!"
190,126o4tf_00191,"With one throw, Ivo has shattered my image of him"
191,126o4tf_00192,So is Kiell acting in Ghosts? Because this all seemed like something his character would do. Especially the singing.
192,126o4tf_00193,So happy to be back watching the best show on tv with you all. Can't wait to see how many pranks Ivo becomes a victim of.
193,126o4tf_00194,One task in and can already tell Ivo is going to be hilariously dreadful
194,126o4tf_00195,The heavy breathing during that dance moved me.
195,126o4tf_00196,Frankie Boyle in a dress had to happen some time
196,126o4tf_00197,Having all the breathing and grunting instead of music is a wonderful touch
197,126o4tf_00198,Alex’s tradition of eating horrendous food is back in full force! Also I’m surprised that ‘over to pricktionary corner’ hadn’t been used before but I loved it.
198,126o4tf_00199,“Trench vagina” is an early candidate for the Taskmaster book of quotes.
199,126o4tf_00200,I'm looking forward to someone putting the actual song to the video of each dance!
200,126o4tf_00201,They're clearly listening to I'm always seeing you (Do cool stuff)
201,126o4tf_00202,Ah progressive Greg
202,126o4tf_00203,"I would have copied the Horne Section's Henry Hoover Chinese Five Spice dance, complete with Henry Hoover helmets"
203,126o4tf_00204,i’m surrounded by yarn for crocheting and the temptation is unbearable
204,126o4tf_00205,"""Well that's a fuck off to you"""
205,126o4tf_00206,"Beep, beep, beep"
206,126o4tf_00207,"Look at Ivo, he's on a mfing boat!"
207,126o4tf_00208,This is why I love Ivo; his comic delivery is so good
208,126o4tf_00209,I can see Ivo buying a barge.
209,126o4tf_00210,"Had a feeling this series would make me fall in love with Ivo and so far, my prediction is correct"
210,126o4tf_00211,Loved the cast. The tasks less so.
211,126o4tf_00212,Ivo just wants to be one of the cool kids like Kiell.
212,126o4tf_00213,"Mae's attention to detail with ""well only two have handles!"" Hells yes, love that for them. Please keep that attention for the next 9 episodes! Weird trivia: this is the first series (UK at least) where the contestants names are only in the first half of the alphabet. Hadn't noticed that when the contestants were announced, but hearing their names in a row brought the realization. So that's something fun...?"
213,126o4tf_00214,"Ivo was so close to playing that live task correctly, but went on the attack one item too soon. If he just picks up his not ball item in round 1 and misses on purpose and then blasts Kiell in round 5 I think he'd have won. Or even waited for Kiell to go, but just firing straight away doomed him."
214,126o4tf_00215,"I had no idea what to expect from Ivo, Jenny and Kiell but I'm already in love with them all. Ivo hugging Jenny and Kiell and Ivo sabotaging each other in the live task were the highlight of the episode for me."
215,126o4tf_00216,"Noticed during the live task, the buckets were elevated to correspond with each person's height rather than just the same height for everyone. Simple detail but first time I've noticed heigh differences being taken into account, which is very cool. Anyway great episode, I usually like to let the series finish and then binge-watch but I was too excited to miss the first one."
216,126o4tf_00217,"""For meeeee"" finally replaced ""Me, Fern Brady, Me Fern Brady"" in the tunes I sing at random moments of the day. I'll miss the rightful queen"
217,126o4tf_00218,"Alex, why do you do these bits to yourself?"
218,126o4tf_00219,That is a magnificent painting!
219,126o4tf_00220,I'm already enjoying Frankie's comments
220,126o4tf_00221,Ah they’re carrying on the wedding bit! Been a long time coming
221,126o4tf_00222,"Okay. The next wedding I go to and the first dance DOESN’T have the worm in it, I will be walking out."
222,126o4tf_00223,Alex Horne's wedding saga continues
223,126o4tf_00224,The lack of music is a very interesting vibe to start the series off with lol
224,126o4tf_00225,"Hang on, we’ve just had Frankie smooching Alex, then a sex toy advert. Are Channel 4 trying to tell us something?"
225,126o4tf_00226,"Ivo being so obsequious is so expected, yet I am so delighted by it."
226,126o4tf_00227,"i knew going in that Mae would be my favourite but i’m already loving them all, especially Jenny and Kiell"
227,126o4tf_00228,"it may be because i'm a viewer of the show, but i feel like i'd instinctively check the back of every task anyway?"
228,126o4tf_00229,Let's go Mae!
229,126o4tf_00230,I hope Frankie breaks in to the taskmaster house at some point to complete the task.
230,126o4tf_00231,Crying with laughter
231,126o4tf_00232,"Off topic but Ed and James were so funny in that celebrity hunted show, really recommend it"
232,126o4tf_00233,IVOOOOO!
233,126o4tf_00234,OH MY GOD
234,126o4tf_00235,Anyone else disappointed in the outfits this season?
235,126o4tf_00236,"Will it also be on All4 at 9:00 pm tonight, or does it take longer for it to get uploaded there?"
236,126o4tf_00237,Ivo has fucked it already
237,126o4tf_00238,frankie's painting seems like something he just wanted to bring in.. because how does it even fit the criteria?
238,126o4tf_00239,I love it when Alex breaks into laughs
239,126o4tf_00240,GOD DAMN IT ALEX YOU SNEAKY SHREW
240,126o4tf_00241,I thought the second part of the task would be to wind the string back up into a ball
241,126o4tf_00242,"Oh, Alex is being so cruel today. Love it."
242,126o4tf_00243,"I think this show is going to break Jenny. ""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?"""
243,126o4tf_00244,I would LOVE a go at this. Hat and all.
244,126o4tf_00245,Is Jenny trying to kill Alex off 😂
245,126o4tf_00246,"Oof, actually feeling nervous for Alex’s safety here 😅"
246,126o4tf_00247,Kiell smashes the task and we get a hit song out of it!
0,12dd2qr_00001,"In the golden present task, did Danielle and Julia sing a carol before opening the final present? I assume they did, since Luke was disqualified for not singing, but did they show it? I didn't catch it when I watched"
1,12dd2qr_00002,"Loved this series. Can't wait to see how it goes from there. Positives: - Both Tom are great in their respectives roles - Lesser Tom is a different kind of assistant than Alex or Paul for me, he looks much more sympathetic, but in a weird and almost unnerving way sometimes. And I love it. I like having variety - Our 5 contestants were incredible. One of my favorite line ups of all time, accross every version. I just love them so much I'll miss them a lot. A bit sad my least favorite won, but oh well, it doesn't really matter. - Tasks were pretty good, and up to the brand standards. Negatives - I feel like the studio parts of the show are a bit lacking. Would need a bit more banter, especially between the Toms. - It goes with my previous point, but I feel like the chemistry between the taskmaster and his assistant is a bit lacking. I know Greg and Alex put the bar really high, but that's also why it feels a bit of a miss here. I hope they can add more general banter to the cut next time. - Scoring sometimes a bit.... eh.. But I can get over it, the Taskmaster doesn't have to be fair, if he wants, but he should maybe play more on that then. But still, a really amazing series, especially for a first one."
2,12dd2qr_00003,Julia saying “you shouldn’t have to deal with that in the workplace” after chucking something towards a cameraperson has really endeared her to me
3,12dd2qr_00004,"My first thought in Episode 1, upon seeing the contestants, was that Luke should not be a contestant, he should be the Taskmaster’s assistant. Lesser Tom though really grew on me over the course of the season, but if ever they need someone to sub in for the role, Luke would be great!"
4,12dd2qr_00005,"Nina joins Fern Brady, Aisling Bea, Charlotte Ritchie and Alice Levine as an impossible standard for the women I meet to live up to."
0,12dm3tt_00001,"Never thought I would use these words about Frankie Boyle, but just found him so cute and adorable in the tasks, can't really explain it 😅"
1,12dm3tt_00002,"“One on a barge pole, for me” is still stuck in my head two weeks later"
2,12dm3tt_00003,Anyone catch what Jenny was apologising for when she hugged Mae in the team task?
3,12dm3tt_00004,"Could someone explain the beaver away joke to me? English isn't my first language and I can't make sense of it (neither can urban dictionary, so I fear I need some pointers...)"
0,12koeoq_00001,I'm all aboard the 'Ivo completely accidentally wins the series' train
1,12koeoq_00002,the thing i love about kiell doing badly is usually the one who is doing the worst in the series takes it all in good humour. keill is absolutely fucking furious about it and he is not afraid of us knowing that.
2,12koeoq_00003,“if you do get extra points for a dead dad” KIELL I LOVE YOU
3,12koeoq_00004,Kiell using the cameraman's watch was genius while it lasted
4,12koeoq_00005,Ivo: I don't care Also Ivo: Visibly caring
5,12koeoq_00006,The vast and unshakeable confidence of Kiell before the task begins compared to his baffled outrage after it has been revealed he has completely fucked it...it's beautiful. I love him.
6,12koeoq_00007,Ivo getting Frankie's kids to beat up their dad makes their effort deserving of five points!
7,12koeoq_00008,Holy shit has Frankie got an internal metronome or something this is impressive
8,12koeoq_00009,"Right, everyone mark “drill down into the narrative” off the series bingo card."
9,12koeoq_00010,Please can someone make a gif of Jenny clapping her hands with her legs in the air at the glee of getting 3 points please please please
10,12koeoq_00011,What you can't take away from Jenny is that she had an absolutely lovely day
11,12koeoq_00012,"""Oh, this sounds brilliant. I'll be so bad at this!"" Jenny Eclair"
12,12koeoq_00013,Dalai Lama joke has not aged well at all💀
13,12koeoq_00014,"Jenny thinking she’d been there half an hour when it was only ten minutes is me, every day at work."
14,12koeoq_00015,Kiell has the cheekiest fucking face man
15,12koeoq_00016,"Loved Alex's intro. ""Greg's gone mad, will it be seven points, nineteen points to everyone? Who knows!"""
16,12koeoq_00017,Frankie bringing gay porn to a prize task was not something i expected this season
17,12koeoq_00018,"Jenny is having the BEST DAY with her potato hat, bless her. I would like her, Mel Geidroyc and Mike Wozniak to have a jolly day out together, yomping through the countryside, united in their boundless positivity and joie de vivre"
18,12koeoq_00019,SHOW THE UNCENSORED
19,12koeoq_00020,“I am weak and cowardly so I’m happy to take the role as victim.” That’s my whole life’s motto.
20,12koeoq_00021,"""all fizzy under your duvet"" is a direct quote from filthy little ferret"
21,12koeoq_00022,"""Well...it is in height""....Kiell you're killing me"
22,12koeoq_00023,“How many letters does the word balloon have?” “Is this a joke.”
23,12koeoq_00024,i think nothing bad should be allowed to happen to jenny eclair at any time and they should just integrate that into the point system
24,12koeoq_00025,mae with a fuckin bangin call back there
25,12koeoq_00026,Ivo sputtering out a monologue of thwarted misery like some sort of Shakespearian villain as potatoes bounced off his noggin was strangely moving
26,12koeoq_00027,“AND HER DAD’S DEAD.”
27,12koeoq_00028,I want to see a children’s show hosted by Charlotte Ritchie and Frankie Boyle. Imagine the therapy those kids would need.
28,12koeoq_00029,"""Get fucked, mate!"" is the appropriate response to hearing a pun"
29,12koeoq_00030,"Alternate episode titles: ""Imagination."" ""Fizzy under your duvet."" ""Hoomliate."" ""Not pot pot not."" ""Weak and cowardly."""
30,12koeoq_00031,jenny has the energy of someone who has never been on time for anything in her life
31,12koeoq_00032,Frankie must have had nightmares of being beaten to death by his children wearing masks of an Old Etonian.
32,12koeoq_00033,Ivo is going insane inside the caravan
33,12koeoq_00034,The anxiety of a contestant being singled out and not knowing if they did amazingly or terribly (although we already kinda know).
34,12koeoq_00035,"From being at the studio record, I really hope they show some of Jenny's cut prize task explanation. There was a whole backstory - her dad was a spy, they started reading from the book used as a background and even why theres a book for the background. The whole prize task section was golden but sadly a lot had to be cut for time"
35,12koeoq_00036,CENSORED Is that a TM first? I expect no less from Boyle
36,12koeoq_00037,Oh my fuck sausage exam possibly the best premise ever
37,12koeoq_00038,All the other contestants: Happy for Jenny. Kiell: tHe InJuStIcE
38,12koeoq_00039,Good to know Ivo’s Eton and Oxford education was worth all that money.
39,12koeoq_00040,Psh the taskmasters gone soft. He should’ve disqualified anyone who touched the hat too.
40,12koeoq_00041,Ah! lol Not a single soul thought the clock not working was an accident and not Alex's doing
41,12koeoq_00042,Slow Mo fight scene is a genuinely brilliant task
42,12koeoq_00043,"Oh, he added more items, the filthy little ferret."
43,12koeoq_00044,Them just getting hit by potatoes whilst talking is sending me
44,12koeoq_00045,“Let’s drill down into the narrative”
45,12koeoq_00046,Can I also just add that I would not bat an eye at Ivo reading a book about flower arranging?
46,12koeoq_00047,Kiell just becoming angrier with his own incompetence is a joy.
47,12koeoq_00048,THE SOUND I MADE WHEN THE EXTRAS IN IVO MASKS APPEARED 💀
48,12koeoq_00049,I fucking love Ivo. That’s the exact kind of nerd shit I’d expect from him.
49,12koeoq_00050,i love kiell’s absolute fury
50,12koeoq_00051,we got mae explaining how a clock works. just taskmaster moments.
51,12koeoq_00052,Frankie has been on fire this episode. Feels like he’s settled into taskmaster this ep
52,12koeoq_00053,I thought Kiell was doing well overall in the show 😭💀
53,12koeoq_00054,Mae absolutely beating everyone to death with their brain as always
54,12koeoq_00055,Sinister children's show is a lay-up for Frankie. I still remember The Racist Door from early Mock the Week.
55,12koeoq_00056,IVO WINS AGAIN INJECT THIS INTO MY VEINS
56,12koeoq_00057,"This task would stress me out. I'm undermining myself, but my timekeeping is abysmal."
57,12koeoq_00058,I don't think I've enjoyed anything in life as much as Jenny enjoyed that task tbh.
58,12koeoq_00059,Kiell - concentrating Jenny - laughing her head off Frankie - unbothered
59,12koeoq_00060,JENNY CACKLING IS SO PURE
60,12koeoq_00061,"He was really tempted to give Frankie 5 points there. Kind of a shame he didn’t, frankly."
61,12koeoq_00062,Okay. Is it just me or does Ivo not look ridiculous in that hat? It just fits in with the mental posho vibe.
62,12koeoq_00063,"Greg and narratives, name a more iconic duo"
63,12koeoq_00064,Frankie and Ivo's fight scene...is surprisingly good!
64,12koeoq_00065,"“A small observation, Kiell looks genuinely furious!”"
65,12koeoq_00066,My assumption is that no-one at Channel 4 knows how to edit the All4 upload schedule.
66,12koeoq_00067,"This task is fucking brilliant Jenny, Jesus Christ"
67,12koeoq_00068,I'VE SMASHED THIS
68,12koeoq_00069,“Welcome to the caravan.”
69,12koeoq_00070,Show us the fanart you cowards
70,12koeoq_00071,“i think it went brilliantly” KISS ME YOU IDIOT
71,12koeoq_00072,How does Mae look so good but the scores aren't showing it Just TM things
72,12koeoq_00073,Ivo has to be the most self-destructive contestant ever.
73,12koeoq_00074,"200,000 Ivo units are ready, with a million more on the way"
74,12koeoq_00075,kiell was robbed
75,12koeoq_00076,Censored on a 9pm showing. Damn Frankie.
76,12koeoq_00077,So whose going to look at all the fanart to see what matches the pixelated screen? Lol
77,12koeoq_00078,Kiell using the cameraman’s watch is genius
78,12koeoq_00079,"""Don't come now, you've ruined it"" hahaha god damn I'm loving Kiell this series"
79,12koeoq_00080,"Greg again with the partner quips, you ok hun?"
80,12koeoq_00081,Ivo being exasperated by this task has elevated this series massively
81,12koeoq_00082,Frankie’s kids must have jumped at the opportunity to beat up their dad.
82,12koeoq_00083,Ivo finding the exam cheat. 👍 Eton wasn't wasted on him. How has he managed to win two on the bounce?
83,12koeoq_00084,5 points for that? I dunno
84,12koeoq_00085,Alex: “Potatotal.” Contestants: “Potatototatol.” Frankie: “Potato total.”
85,12koeoq_00086,"I assume they didn't want to DQ everybody again, but strange they brought up touching the pen but not touching the hat."
86,12koeoq_00087,"hmiliate- mae martin, taskmaster, series 15, episode 3"
87,12koeoq_00088,"I love Alex nodding along to ""Drill down into the narrative"""
88,12koeoq_00089,"As an Australian, I am very happy to see some representation of one of greatest traditions - the democracy sausage. A delicious tradition, a monument to voting. Now enshrined in Taskmaster as a Fun Fact."
89,12koeoq_00090,If someone deliberately went out of their way to not touch the pen to follow the rules it probs should disqualify the others. Not that it matters but it's a bit unfair
90,12koeoq_00091,A friend needs a link for “filthy little ferret”…
91,12koeoq_00092,i love how excited jenny is to fuck this up
92,12koeoq_00093,Jenny's laugh is amazing
93,12koeoq_00094,Yes! We're drilling down into the narrative!
94,12koeoq_00095,"The first ""drill down into the narrative"" of the series?"
95,12koeoq_00096,Not from the UK so sailing the high seas to watch the episode and I found myself watching Channel 4 with audio description. Currently hearing a description of the whole fight which ends up adding a nice touch to it lol
96,12koeoq_00097,Maybe Ivo isn't as bad at this as we thought he'd be
97,12koeoq_00098,Ivo and Frankie - the best team in ever against all logic
98,12koeoq_00099,"""It's time for the sausage exam, ding ding"" - Horne, A"
99,12koeoq_00100,"Ivo smashed that episode 😂. From zero to hero in no time flat. Went from looking like a Wang to looking like a dark horse if he carries on like this. Are these the two strongest teams we've ever had? Both team tasks have worked well, and surprisingly Frankie and Ivo are doing very well together. Poor Kiell though. So many DQs"
100,12koeoq_00101,sometimes watching Ivo feels like when a character in a cartoon tries coffee for the first time and they go all crazy and start running around and climbing walls and talking really fast and stuff. and I’m so happy for him
101,12koeoq_00102,Rather poorly aged dalai lama reference
102,12koeoq_00103,"I don’t know about anyone else, but that chocolate face looks like literal shit to me rather than chocolate."
103,12koeoq_00104,KIELL IS SO PISSED AT ONE POINT EVERY TIME
104,12koeoq_00105,Just put Mae in champion of champions already
105,12koeoq_00106,Another painting from Frankie. I’m noticing a theme!
106,12koeoq_00107,jenny is having a joe wilkinson moment
0,12t2pje_00001,Wasnt frankie supposed to leave one bubble unpopped on the wrap? But the he burnt the whole thing? Or did i miss something? Lmk thanks xxx
1,12t2pje_00002,Ce ci n'est pas une banane.
2,12t2pje_00003,For those wondering: It's 1 kilogram per liter.
3,12t2pje_00004,"I haven't seen the final episode yet, but I was at the taping and I KNEW that ""How heavy is the water"" was going to be the episode quote."
4,12t2pje_00005,
5,12t2pje_00006,Anyone else think Mae was robbed in the prize task? The blow up Mae cracked me up. I think they just need a little help from Judi Dench on selling their prizes
6,12t2pje_00007,Can someone please let me know the length of this episode on All4? I’ve just noticed a couple of jokes mentioned in this thread which I don’t remember from watching it on Binge (Australian streaming service). I’ll be livid if they’re streaming a version that’s been edited down. Edit: should mention that the episode length on Binge is 44:44.
7,12t2pje_00008,"It does not surprise me in the slightest that Frankie decided to lob a fucking wheelie bin onto a public footpath, and then set plastics on fire. Typical Friday night behaviour in Glasgow."
8,12t2pje_00009,Ivo having an awkward phone chat with his ex-doctor was hilarious
9,12t2pje_00010,"I loved the whole group of them getting in to debate Mae's scoring. Usually there's just one Ardal, now there's a whole cast of Ardals"
10,12t2pje_00011,“I don’t throw my penis across the room every morning”. Nothings made me laugh as much as that in TM for a while.
11,12t2pje_00012,“is his name slash?” “greg” this has absolutely wrecked me
12,12t2pje_00013,Kiell is going to murder someone by the end of this season
13,12t2pje_00014,"""I just wish I had kept up origami during the drug years"". I hadn't really thought about this before but Frankie Boyle is definitely the hardest contestant they've had on the show."
14,12t2pje_00015,Kiell has achieved 1 point across all 4 studio tasks
15,12t2pje_00016,Kiell has the cheekiest face i've ever seen
16,12t2pje_00017,"I don't think I could have ever conceived that the 'delighted with life' Taskmaster successor to Mike ""I've had an absolutely lovely day"" Wozniak would be... Frankie Boyle."
17,12t2pje_00018,"""John! John! My feet hurt John!"" ""Come back inside..."""
18,12t2pje_00019,"I like how Frankie is a really chilled version of himself on this, but still goes quite dark by TM standards on occasion He's perfectly found the tone of the show without being limited by it. Total pro. Great episode, mostly for the needle in the studio. Feels like 12 and 14 had a quite wholesome family dynamic while 13 and 15 have been more chaotic."
19,12t2pje_00020,Banana not being a banana but Mae getting away with the throw bullshit is the biggest injustice in the history of mankind
20,12t2pje_00021,"Dropping a ball, tying it up with string, amd yo-yoing it from drum to drum is not a throw. Skipping task after task to engineer the perfect bingo line, then sitting in the entirely wrong part of the Taskmaster grounds? Now THAT is a throw."
21,12t2pje_00022,"I have to wonder how many other semantics arguments like this have been cut for time over the years, because I could honestly watch just this all day"
22,12t2pje_00023,"THAT WAS THE IVO TASK I WAS HOPING FOR WHEN HE WAS ANNOUNCED, JUST BREAKDOWN AFTER BREAKDOWN! TV HERITAGE"
23,12t2pje_00024,"Well that was undoubtedly the best episode in several seasons of Taskmaster, I feel. Frankie was delightfully bitey and so encouraged Mae to get proper pass-agg in response. Kiell grew increasingly deranged in his lust for points, Ivo tumbled once more into the depths of depair, and and Jenny continued to have a lovely time, mostly."
24,12t2pje_00025,"Kiell’s face when Frankie’s egg fell out, plus the jiggly legs. He was like a kid getting a present."
25,12t2pje_00026,Ivo is having a bad time and it's adorable.
26,12t2pje_00027,Nice to see Mae carrying on Nina Oyama's legacy of grabbing an unneeded hat just to look good while doing the task.
27,12t2pje_00028,This episode has some of the best studio banter we've ever had
28,12t2pje_00029,Mae should deffo have been DQed for their swinging. The audience reaction was telling. Nobody was impressed.
29,12t2pje_00030,“This whole episode has been such a journey through language and meaning” Jenny is my favorite but in a way maybe I love Frankie the most
30,12t2pje_00031,"This show is so much better when the contestants argue and banter. I mean it’s great all the time, but it’s better when they argue."
31,12t2pje_00032,“We’ll litigate this for hours” he wasn’t kidding
32,12t2pje_00033,"If I had a pound for every time a taskmaster contestant asked about the weight of water, I’d have two pounds. Which isn’t much, but its weird that it happened twice."
33,12t2pje_00034,"Why does Frankie Boyle, the largest contestant, not simply eat the other contestants?"
34,12t2pje_00035,Jenny's pure elation at everything is such a different energy than I thought she'd be like. I love her.
35,12t2pje_00036,Kiell’s facial comedy is top notch
36,12t2pje_00037,"this was one of the best episodes in the show's history: the group argument over 'throwing' culminating in the mental image of Frankie just lobbing a fishing rod into the water, Kiell with no shoes on... i was in actual hysterics watching Ivo sit in the caravan. this series is so so good"
37,12t2pje_00038,Watching Ivo be so polite when trying to get off the phone with John is not doing anything to lessen the ridiculous crush I have on him.
38,12t2pje_00039,“It’s quite a soothing task” - cut to Ivo running across carrying a barrel above his head
39,12t2pje_00040,"The analysis of Mae's throw and the ensuing jokes in the studio is one of the GOAT segments from this show, easily"
40,12t2pje_00041,IM SORRY WHAT DID IVO JUST SAY ABOUT HIS PENIS AND WHY DID EVERYONE MOVE ON SO QUICKLY
41,12t2pje_00042,That was not a throw. It was worth it to see Kiell face.
42,12t2pje_00043,I have no idea how Mae got away with that ‘throw’. Greg made an awful decision allowing that.
43,12t2pje_00044,"Mildly interesting (maybe just to me): Taskmaster is how my parents just learned that non-binary is a thing. They asked me if Mae is a boy or a girl, and I explained that they’re non-binary. Took my parents a bit to comprehend what that means."
44,12t2pje_00045,Greg messing with Kiell is my new favourite thing
45,12t2pje_00046,"Y’all, I just want a season comprised of past contestants who really loved doing tasks and being on taskmaster. Jenny Eclair, Chris Ramsey, Mike Wozniak, and Mo Farah would probably be 4 of my picks - still trying to decide my 5th."
46,12t2pje_00047,Kiell’s near constant fury is fast becoming my favourite thing
47,12t2pje_00048,Loved all the scenes of medical care in this episode
48,12t2pje_00049,"Lots of argumentation and disqualification on this episode. Fun quotes throughout. The litigation around Mae's ""throw"" was hilarious. Ivo: ""There's definite wrist, Greg, but I don't throw my penis across the room every morning, do I?""Jenny: ""Do you use string?"" ""Race, Alex?""""Caucasian, Greg."" I laughed at the depressingly sad music when Mae's boat struggled. Then at the fact that Frankie had absolutely no reaction when his egg got loose. ""I had essentially just wrapped an egg in some paper. I can have few complaints."" Greg: ""Oh, I just said that to have a look at Kiell's face."" I love Kiell's refrain of ""I don't have any shoes on."" Only to willingly take them off at the live task. Alex: ""Now, for the two you're most likely to find in a Bingo hall...""Jenny: ""Oh, I'm not standing for this shit!"" Frankie: ""In the middle of that task, I decided to go back to therapy."" Greg to Jenny: ""Normally a scene that would be followed by 'Come back inside...'"" Greg: ""I won't be pissing against the door."" Frankie: ""I wasn't going to eat the sign!"" Watching Ivo get through his Bingo tasks was so much fun (especially the satisfying way he knocked down that banana). ""It's shoe time!"" Shades of Mike Wozniak. ""Sometimes, rather than a lot of chit-chat, you can just sum things up with an image."" Frankie: ""It's like having a really boringly long piss."" Greg: ""Being our age, this kind of stream is quite normal for Frankie and I."" Those full disqualifications are tough. It's surprisingly hard to keep a steady sand flow. Frankie: ""To be honest, the whole episode has been such a thrilling journey through language and meaning."""
49,12t2pje_00050,"As much as I agree that the sign saying banana is not a banana, I don't think Frankie should have been disqualified because his final bingo line didn't include the banana task (but Jenny's did).... especially given that Ivo revealed a bunch of tasks without doing them at all. I actually liked Ivo's approach in the bingo task to reveal all the tasks and then do the easiest (even though he just did a lot of them). I think I would have done something similar, but hopefully have had the wherewithal to be systematic and chose the line that seemed to have the quickest and easiest tasks in it (in which case, I think either the top line or the first column). I say this, but under the TM pressure, I'd probably just freak out and screw around like Ivo."
0,130n53a_00001,"Watched this a bit later than usual, so I'm still processing the episode. Thought for the most part it was a fine episode, I correctly called that Ivo and Frankie wouldn't get back to the room in time, I just didn't quite expect the self-sabotage from Ivo (Maybe Frankie in a high pitched voice is less sinister and allowed him not to be scared back into the room). And then the elephant at the end. I'm not a fan of live team tasks since usually, one team has a more favourable grouping, and I'm especially not a fan of double points or one person wins all the points rounds because it doesn't feel right to me. I actually wondered if they'd give the team of 2 fewer items so they had a chance, and even they almost won with the same amount of items. But that second part was not thought through at all. It might have worked if they'd had to stuff marbles or something that would have gotten lost in the suit, but as other people have noted, 60 seconds for 3 people to find 29 fairly large items isn't terribly difficult. And then get double points whereas if it had gone the other way the team of two would only have got 5? The whole thing seemed set up to gift the team of three all the points, the only time I remember something more blatent happening was putting Ed on a team with David Baddiel . When an episode ends on such a sour note it can't help but leave a bad taste in the mouth."
1,130n53a_00002,"Fake was great - and fake Alex genuinely creeped me out in the intro - and the spoon one was ok. Music one was a largely boring watch except for the Kiell fake out. I'm not that mad about the scoring because I don't really mind who wins (Frankie's my favorite but I've come to terms with him not winning since like, ep 2)."
2,130n53a_00003,"This may be the first season where I just find myself wanting most of the tasks to end (quickly). The music task is bad and presented poorly, the final task is just stupid and unfair, the spoon task is fine but that whole 'lead a blind teammate' thing has been done to death and forcing them to go back to the lab is pretty pointless plus actually makes it less interesting because it means they won't be able to find the more interesting spoon spots or be creative about it since they're on a tight timer and need to stay near the house. Frankie is really the only thing keeping this season interesting."
3,130n53a_00004,"My only disappointment in the live task is that Frankie and Ivo pretty much laid down and died about it. They could have been shouting, clanging their stuff, throwing it around, generally sabotaging the others-- and instead they mostly hung out looking vaguely interested in the counting process until a few things got flung at the end. It's easy to say that the task was unbalanced in how it turned out, but imagine the ensuing chaos of different counters coming up with different numbers and haggling over it at the end, distracted by toilet brushes and saucepans flying through the air! With that in mind, I think the 10-5 point distribution makes sense. The counting task could have been so, so much harder, and worth the 10-point payout if executed under different conditions. It's too bad we didn't get that chaos, but I don't have a problem with how it turned out anyways, because at the end of the day it's lovely to see silly people doing dumb stuff."
4,130n53a_00005,"I'm actually very surprised at the point distribution. The last task definitely made everything unfair, but even if we remove all those 10 points and pretend everyone got disqualified. Ivo is still somehow coming in last behind Kiell even though he's won 2 eps. Mae and Jenny would still be on top though obviously not an outrageous near 20 point lead. And if we swap those 10 points around, Frankie's winning but Ivo is still only 4th which is hilarious."
5,130n53a_00006,I think the spoon magnet task is my new favorite task. I laughed so hard at the high pitched banter between Ivo and Frankie.
6,130n53a_00007,
7,130n53a_00008,"I do think that final task was incredibly unfair to Frankie and Ivo on every level. (Not that it matters, obviously, but still, poor Team Dad and Son)"
8,130n53a_00009,That double points stipulation has fucked Ivo and Frankie so hard
9,130n53a_00010,"Run Ivo, I don't care if you hurt yourself!"
10,130n53a_00011,Why is Frankie English when he does a high pitched voice it's hysterical!
11,130n53a_00012,"""Were you feeling pressured, Ivo, or did you go into the kitchen?"" I felt a moral obligation to call emergency services after that burn injury."
12,130n53a_00013,"I really didn’t like the point scoring at the end there. Felt like it gave a massive score advantage to Mae who really didn’t need it at this stage in the game. I hope Frankie can claw back some points in the next few eps because his 4th place does not reflect his generally solid performance. Also, Ivo, go to the lab you spoon hungry psychopath!"
13,130n53a_00014,"I liked how caring Frankie initially was in guiding Ivo, telling him the height of objects where he may get hurt for example. Then by the end it was just, Run! I don’t care if you get hurt! Followed by some somewhat justified verbal abuse!"
14,130n53a_00015,"Even though I KNOW it's not that serious and it's just for fun and it doesn't matter etc etc, that final task was horrendous to watch for someone with an Ed Gamble sense of competitiveness and fury toward injustice. Did not enjoy it one bit."
15,130n53a_00016,"Frankie and Ivo were screwed over, might be the most unfair task in the show’s history"
16,130n53a_00017,"I genuinely gasped, Ivo that was fantastic"
17,130n53a_00018,I am not a fan of tasks that give more than 5 Points (and zero to the rest)
18,130n53a_00019,I’ve stopped listening to both of you 😂
19,130n53a_00020,Kielle last week: “How heavy is the water?” Kielle this week: “What’s in there [an egg].” He’s become quite suspicious of the show of late.
20,130n53a_00021,i was thinking it was a poor effort from ivo... and then my jaw dropped
21,130n53a_00022,Mae's face when Alex said they look like Dick Van Dyke lmfao
22,130n53a_00023,Slightly unfair advantage for this one surely? EDIT: OH GOD
23,130n53a_00024,"No more team live tasks, the inherent unfairness is more annoying than the amusement factor. Kiell had no chance to beat Mae and the whole idea of getting 10 points for checks notes for three people counting up to 29 was extremely annoying. Poor Ivo was done a dirty this episode, he was stiffed in the live task and him and Mae should have won the faking task since they were the only successful fakers."
24,130n53a_00025,"Daedalus and Icarus for the modern day. Ivo, my boy, you flew too close to the sun."
25,130n53a_00026,Remember how pissed Romesh was at the beans point. He'd have killed someone for that points swing
26,130n53a_00027,"Ivo fucked it. ""You greedy bastard!"""
27,130n53a_00028,I love that Ivo doesn’t need to speak like that and Frankie even tells him so and he continues to do so anyway.
28,130n53a_00029,"I think Jenny was so close to having a good prize task but messed it up just at the end. She says her grandson is the luckiest lad in the land because he has her as a nana. Instead of then offering up the photo as the prize (which obviously no one wants, thus scoring poorly), she should have offered to be the nana of whoever wins the task. Wouldn't Jenny be a fun grandmother?"
29,130n53a_00030,I've decided I massively hate that random ten point task.
30,130n53a_00031,I'm gonna fucking kick off Alex 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
31,130n53a_00032,"Mae and Ivo were robbed in the 'best fake' task. Frankie's fake death was funny as hell, but the sheer shock factor of Ivo, plus Mae freaking the fuck out of Alex were both 5 points worthy. What a brilliant task. Shout out to Kiell making a fake hand, but making the wrong one..."
32,130n53a_00033,"""Frankie, can you beat a baby?"""
33,130n53a_00034,The way I actually gasped at the twist in Ivos faking task
34,130n53a_00035,Imagine being guided by your grandma and Mickey Mouse...
35,130n53a_00036,"Having slept on it, yes the one man band task was a bit boring and yes the live task was upsetting, but there were moments of brilliance for me too! Kiell's ""fake"" had me SCREAMIN with laughter. I had no idea where he was going with that and when it was revealed I lost it. Ivo's fake out was absolutely genius, maybe one of the best cons on TM, and it's appalling he didn't win 5 points. Ivo heading to the kitchen was painfully hilarious and the teamwork with him and Frankie the entire time was a delight."
36,130n53a_00037,"Aw that final live task felt so unfair to Ivo and Frankie. I think it was engineered to give them an advantage by giving the team of three an extra task, until Mae unexpectedly smashed it. Of course, doesn’t undermine the episode at all which was another delight. Love this cast."
37,130n53a_00038,Not a fan of the points scoring at the end there
38,130n53a_00039,Seeing a lot of negativity but I found kyal hilarious in this episode. Especially him having to explain over and over he couldn't see the things they were describing in the spoons tasks and just gave up listening and felt his way back haha
39,130n53a_00040,I’m not sure Mae and Jenny know how blindfolds work
40,130n53a_00041,that was a lot of points for the team of three in a very short amount of time!
41,130n53a_00042,Mae and Frankie did so well that either Kiell is a savant at this game or we’re about to see an absolute disaster
42,130n53a_00043,Kiell’s fake hand was so hilariously shit
43,130n53a_00044,Ivo trying to sabotage them hah
44,130n53a_00045,"Is that the most unfair advantage for a team of 3 in any team task? Surely Frankie should have had the whole time and Mae/Jenny have one go first and then swap. And the to add the double points… I mean, obviously none of this matters, but still."
45,130n53a_00046,"this season's cast and tasks have been wonderful, but the scoring has been so weird from the start"
46,130n53a_00047,I am loving Kiell in the studio. He's so competitive but he also desperately doesn't want to be an ass about it.
47,130n53a_00048,"This might be the most mixed bag of episode ever. The ""Best Fake"" was excellent all around, even Kiell's hand, but Ivo was robbed of 5 points given both Alex AND Greg's reaction. The Spoon Magnet task was also great. I loved Ivo sympathetically also doing a high-pitched voice, and the fact that Father & Son absolutely smashed it but flew too close to the son and lost it all. On the flip side, the music task was very disappointing. This was the first we ever saw of our cast and it was from a pretty mediocre task. And that live task? Oh my, what a disaster. At that point, Ivo and Frankie were already losing the episode (and I believe the series?), but suddenly the trio who were ALREADY WINNING were given 10 points for their task? It would've been pretty unfair on Ivo and Frankie to helplessly watch the trio win even if it was for 5 points, but 10 points for guessing the number of items? When the alternative is Frankie and Ivo getting 5? This task really doesn't work on any level, and I'm surprised it made into the show, never mind with a 10 point bounty."
48,130n53a_00049,One of the spoooooons....for meeeeeeee
49,130n53a_00050,Frankie and Ivo's high-pitched double act made this episode.
50,130n53a_00051,"I don’t mind the idea of getting double the points for the live task, I just felt the task itself was designed unfairly. The team of 3 had a clear advantage as they had an extra set of hands. And then when it came to guessing the number of items they were given time to be able to pull things out and start counting them. Unless they super screwed up, Frankie and Ivo realistically never had a shot of winning."
51,130n53a_00052,"Let's just be clear here, points may not matter, but seriously a 15 point swing (it was either 10 for the team of 3 or 5 for the team of 2, no in betweens) is too much. Worse still Ivo and Frankie's hands were kinda tied. If it was just a 5 points instead of 0 maybe still not too bad. There's room to be arbitrary and play around, but this way just way too steep. Yes, nothing matters ultimately and it's all fun, but we want the competition and results to be organic from the floor (eg Greg's on a whim judgments or by arguing on the task). Hope Alex notes this for future iterations."
52,130n53a_00053,That went from shit to fucking clever.
53,130n53a_00054,"Maybe Kiell will make this task worthwhile, but as of now I'm struggling to think of a task that the studio audience has laughed at less."
54,130n53a_00055,Ivo snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
55,130n53a_00056,"Man, Frankie, and mostly Ivo got screwed this episode. I'm deeply disappointed Ivo didn't win the faking task, I think the fact that he actually managed to trick Alex and Greg should've given him the automatic victory there. They also did so much better with the spoons instead of directing someone to items they have no way of knowing where it would be, but of course they didn't manage to complete task. Though for the final task I feel that they just had an inherent disadvantage, 2 people can stuff items into a place much faster than just 1."
56,130n53a_00057,"Why it is so controversial to say ""It's an okay series I guess"" and giving valid criticism afterwards? Everyone seems to be in absolute love with Mae, and while i also like them - I feel like they're the blandest of all 5 this season. They have this ""One of the contestants dropped out on the last minute and the producers picked someone out from the audience"" vibe. It really feels like Mae way too afraid to make any joke. They're really good in many of the tasks, but outside of them - completely passive and reserved. And as many of you are saying, the tasks are the foundations on which the humour is created. Being passive and reserved doesn't help with building jokes. It's kinda like pouring chocolate over a full English breakfast - both these things on their own are awesome, but them combined is way less than sum of its parts. A lot of tasks this series are - in my opinion - subpar. Either the premise was weird, the scoring rubbed me the wrong way or the trope is overused - it happens this series more often than in previous ones. Apart from yesterday's live team task that was mentioned in so many comments - and seems to be the only criticism about this series that is somewhat accepted here - we had: A task that was written on the back of the envelope, with a decoy being inside At least four tasks with answers or aids being hidden in plain sight, three of them being in the same episode, also two of them being final tasks At least three (arguably four) tasks based on performing to or creating music 3 minutes of boring 'pretend-to-be-psychic' sketch (and recieving 4 points) Jenny getting one point for blowing a fire away - same as Kiell and Ivo who couldn't even complete their ideas with just a single breath (and arguably - three performances based on the same concept). Bop it"
57,130n53a_00058,"Ivo and Frankie on the spoon task is going in my personal tasks hall of fame, I'm still cackling about it"
58,130n53a_00059,That's some BS scoring in that last task gotta feel for team of 2. Instantly bottom of the series
59,130n53a_00060,"That live task was the biggest bullshit this show has ever pulled, frankie and ivo have no chance of winning the series at this point"
60,130n53a_00061,Sarah and her horn noise would have been on absolute fire here.
61,130n53a_00062,"I doubt Ivo or Frankie were going to win the series anyway, but that live task basically guaranteed it. What an absolutely stupid scoring system there."
62,130n53a_00063,"I was already upset when I first watched the live team task thinking if it was an double-or-nothing approach to BOTH teams. But on a rewatch and listening to the instructions, i realised it was way worse: - If team of three won, they get 10 each, team of two gets 0. - If team of three loses, they get 0, team of two only get 5 each. How is that possibly fair? And then they throw in the card. I was so looking forward to Frankie clawing back for a win."
63,130n53a_00064,Arnold Bartleby 🤝 Smooth Rupert
64,130n53a_00065,"""I like cheese and cash."" Don't we all?"
65,130n53a_00066,"I love how much Frankie is enjoying all this, seems to be quite a cathartic experience for him"
66,130n53a_00067,"""Is this like an Alzheimer's test?"" Lmao"
67,130n53a_00068,I was wondering why Alex was trying to hurry Kiell on to play the instruments but it makes sense now lol
68,130n53a_00069,"If you told me at the start of the series that Frankie would be yelling at Ivo for being a greedy bastard in a Mrs Doubtfire voice, I really wouldn't know what to say."
69,130n53a_00070,Actually I'd call that final task the worst moment in TM history
70,130n53a_00071,"I don't really care about the points and I watch Taskmaster for the tasks, but I'm really upset with the points system on the last live task. Obviously, the group of three had an advantage (in numbers). Halfway through and there is already a +20 point difference between the top two and the bottom two. It seems it's going to be between Mae Martin and Jenny Eclair for the win."
71,130n53a_00072,"Did the team task remind anyone of the old classic kids' TV show ""Knightmare""? A person in headgear blinding them has to be navigated by people on the other end of a camera through a course where they have to pick lots of things up, and the people are speaking in high-pitched, one could say ""child-like"" voices. Also Holy fuck that live task scoring is absolute horseshit. You set up a task inherently easier for the team of three, then give then ANOTHER task easier with three people that lets them double their points. What the absolute fuck is this horseshit. That might be the worst scoring rules they've done and it ruined a really great episode and live task."
72,130n53a_00073,Maybe Kiell has come down with a condition called Honkfoot because he didn't have any shoes on
73,130n53a_00074,"""""Don't know where the drum is"" ""Don't know where the bathtub is"" Someone explain to Mae how blindfolds work lol"
74,130n53a_00075,Why is Ivo doing the voice 😂
75,130n53a_00076,Is anybody else having this weird fever dream where Frankie and Ivo are doing the Monty Python women voices?
76,130n53a_00077,Aw the kitchen was such a good idea! If only he went in there earlier
77,130n53a_00078,The contestants are great but the scoring is really starting to get annoying this series.
78,130n53a_00079,"I was actually enjoying the episode up until the Live Task. It felt like the opposite of the Horse-Laminator task. It looked from the outset that it was weighted towards the team of three, but then they announced a twist! Which ended up weighting it even more in favor of the team of three. It made me wonder, what was the point of the team of two even being up there in the first place?"
79,130n53a_00080,"i’m surprised that so many people have complaints about this episode, personally all i can think about is frankie and ivo’s spoon task. instantly in my top 5 favourite tasks, i was in absolute hysterics (i understand peoples complaints but realistically Ivo was always going to end up in the bottom and Frankie has time to claw it back, and as someone else pointed out the live task was weighted in the team of 2’s favour with them having the card with 29, Mae just pulled an absolute miracle. but, all that said, i’m personally just not someone who cares that much about the scoring, each to their own)"
80,130n53a_00081,"""You guys have to be aware of how this blindfold works"""
81,130n53a_00082,Last two tasks together put a 15 point swing. Absolute bullshit. I know many don’t care about the points and that it’s the friends we made along the way or whatever bullshit but for me I love the competition as well. That live task was badly designed from the outset and it’s ruined the competitiveness of the entire series.
82,130n53a_00083,The final task has me tilted just like that one where Mae got away with shit last time
83,130n53a_00084,"Live team tasks don't work in the format, like I can't remember the scores because I don't care that much but as soon as it gets announced the episode is unwinnable for three players."
84,130n53a_00085,"At the turn of the century, just as Bruce was wading into football management, he also wrote a bewildering trilogy of murder-mystery novels, titled Striker!, Sweeper! and Defender! in which a protagonist named Steve Barnes is dragged away from his day job in football manager to solve a murder case. May need to track these down"
85,130n53a_00086,Alex laughing at Ivo's mummy was a delight
86,130n53a_00087,How many people on this show know Alex's wife!
87,130n53a_00088,"ALEX, DON'T DO THIS TO KIELL!"
88,130n53a_00089,Why is Ivo doing the voice too?!🤣
89,130n53a_00090,you greedy bastard
90,130n53a_00091,"As much as I like Taskmaster, this is probably one of the worst seasons yet. There isn't any season where every task is a hit, but a lot of these miss - watching a bunch of grown adults play Bop It got boring pretty fast, and I nearly fell asleep during the psychic reading skit that went on for some three minutes. As far as points are concerned, we've had Mae's incident last week and Frankie and Ivo having virtually no chance at the 10 point task this week, which just feels like rubbish. ""Points don't matter"" is a fairly common sentiment, but feels like cope: I think a lot of the show's humor comes from the fact that you are invested in who wins the tasks - even if the prize is insignificant and the points are ultimately arbitrary."
91,130n53a_00092,Alex’s reactions while Mae was giving the reading had me cracking up.
92,130n53a_00093,"I normally try to comment the day of the episode, oh well I still like to document my thoughts somewhere: Prize Task: Luckiest thing, surprised we haven't had this before. Yeah Jenny's was pretty weak, while Kiell smashed this he certainly deserved the 5. Also great banter between them all. Task 1 (proper): Fun idea, I felt sure that since the task was fake, there would be a real proper task hiding elsewhere. Ivo deserved the 5 though, he completely fooled me, and it obviously it took Greg & Alex by surprise. Thought Mae's was very weak though, despite the research it still felt very haphazard and not impressive. (or maybe I just don't care for mediums in general). Frankie was also hysterical, glad how dark it went then the hilarious reveal of him running semi-nude. Task 2: When we saw the one man band outfit in the reveal trailer I was looking forward to this one. But disappointed, it was just a game of Simon. Also with the editing I was a bit confused whether the lights were actually going faster or not. Alex seems determined to undermine Kiell as much as possible which is grating on me a bit. Glad Greg at least gave him the bonus point. Task 3: Fun one. I liked the stipulation that the spoons had to be collected with the magnet. My heart went out for Kiell as Mae & Jenny were awful at directing. Frankie's high pitched voice was brilliant. It's also a shame that they thought of the brilliant hack with the kitchen but Ivo didn't make it back in time. Live Task: Didn't really like this one. I'm already not a fan of live team tasks as it stops certain contestants from winning an episode if they have a teammate ahead of them. But also this one just didn't feel right when Mae & Jenny could take items out and Kiell could take his hands off his head, all made it too easy for them. And them getting so many points because of it also felt pretty unfair considering Frankie & Ivo could only win points if the other team failed. Combined with the team task, having 15 points to 3 contestants, but 0 to 2 over two tasks swings the series scores very hard which I don't like. Felt similar when in series 12 we had the popcorn and bell task with contestants getting -2 points. Overall maybe the weakest episode of the series for me, the One Man Band and especially the Live Task brought it down a fair bit. At least the comedy between the contestants was still very strong, that saved it for me from actively disliking the episode though. Additional little bit, I loved the deleted scene of Ivo in the prize task going off on one about Jenny using the death of her father for points."
93,130n53a_00094,"Such a stupid thing, but ""Put the spoons in your pouch, Ivo!"" was my biggest laugh."
94,130n53a_00095,Kiell sounds so unimpressed with their instructions 😂
95,130n53a_00096,"Alternate episode titles: ""Cheese and cash."" ""Horace and Boris."" ""Overwhelmed by the occasion."" ""Grope in the grass."""
96,130n53a_00097,"Could swear Alex said Ivo couldn't take his hands off his head, yet Kiell did and it wasn't penalised?"
97,130n53a_00098,"Anyone else get a bit of a jump scare by this? Kiell's fake hand was hilarious, but Frankie faking his own death (and running away in the distance) is what got me. Lots of fun quotes and Ivo-isms this episode. Here are but a few: ""Greatest privilege of my life to sit here and watch your heart be put back together by my twist."" ""I've put all this clobber on and I've become overwhelmed by the occasion."" ""I thought we'd been grouped together as equal failures, but it turns out I've found still a new depth."" Jenny's sad honk walk in silhouette was so apt. That type of ""Simon"" task would have driven me crazy. I'm also a bit disappointed that for all their kit, they never got to use the cymbal. Keill: ""I'm an asthmatic boy."" Followed soon thereafter by: ""I'm going to fucking kick off, Alex."" Greg: ""It seems that music boy is a cheeky boy."" Frankie and Ivo were such a good team in the spoon task. Ivo's idea to go to the kitchen was brilliant, if only they had done that straight away. It gutted me that Ivo was only off by a few seconds. Frankie (high pitched voice): ""I'm going to guide you into a situation of some danger."" Wow, that live task was extremely unfair because the team of three had every advantage. Though I loved Ivo's attempt to sabotage by shaking off a few items in their direction. Greg: ""This is the most excited I've been for 10 years!"" Ivo, upon receiving zero points: ""That is terrible news to receive with a toilet brush up your shirt."" Damn, this season has been going by fast. I didn't realize we were already at the halfway point."
98,130n53a_00099,Better than last week for sure. The mummy move was genius and the sad clown walk off was hiliarious. I agree that the scoring has gone to shit but it never really mattered to me anyways.
99,130n53a_00100,Hilarious episode but I’m finding the more the series goes on the less I’m enjoying Mae. Probably one of my least favourite contestants of all time
100,130n53a_00101,"How nice to come to this sub to get the all the fun sucked out of me after a great episode. Oh, well. All or nothing tasks are generally not my favorite but I don't really understand the amount of complaints about how it was unfair for any team in particular. If they got the number wrong by just one, which could have easily happened, I don't think there would have been this much outrage. I really liked the spoon task, it's great when they add something stupid like the high pitched voice that has no bearing on the actual task, it brings a lot of extra entertainment value. The music task was fun too, reminded me of the time when Nish kicked the basketball through the hoop ""on his first try"". I was shocked that Kiell did so well at first."
101,130n53a_00102,"The rules for the live task were a joke. One team getting 10 points while the other gets 0, and a rule that you give all your points to the other team. Essentially that puts 2 of the contestants out of the running entirely for this series. I really haven't been a fan of the scoring in this series. With Greg deciding to discard a rule at random and then this."
102,130n53a_00103,After the linguistic debate last week Frankie has decided to be Big Nitpicky Bastard and I love it.
103,130n53a_00104,"Oh, Ivo pulled it back!"
104,130n53a_00105,"Mae's being a medium A Mae-dium, if you will."
105,130n53a_00106,I love Alex during Mae’s attempt
106,130n53a_00107,That was such a gentle and adorable laugh/smile from Alex at the end of the medium reading
107,130n53a_00108,Of course Frankie goes dark for his 'faking it' task
108,130n53a_00109,Someone at the start of the season someone told me I remind them of Kiell. I thought what a great compliment. What a winner. I'm sat here watching his fake cake hand thinking what could you do better.
109,130n53a_00110,"""I can't see the bath"""
110,130n53a_00111,"If Kiell manages to get through to the end of episode 10 without losing his poor mind, I will be very impressed."
111,130n53a_00112,"Why is Ivo doing the voice, haha"
112,130n53a_00113,"Man these reactions are reminding me why I stopped coming here after episodes. Watching it was a blast imo, and even the music task was enjoyable from an aesthetic POV and how much fun Frankie had doing it. The final task made a very silly situation thrilling TV so again I enjoyed it. Just a bummer to then come on here to see tons of complaints about points. I get it that it's important to some fans but I mean there's a lot in Taskmaster which comes down to luck and subjectivity so treating it like a serious fair competition strikes me as a pointless exercise. Ivo would've been fine if he hadn't flopped in other tasks. I do feel bad for Frankie coming close to winning two episodes now and losing at the last minute."
113,130n53a_00114,Oh my god Ivo
114,130n53a_00115,Surely the team of three have the advantage here...
115,130n53a_00116,"That last task was a bit shit for the team of 2, unfair in both part 1 and 2 of the task really and now there's a huge gap, I hope they both get a task in the future that's easier for the team of 2 to balance it a bit"
116,130n53a_00117,Double points makes no sense. Surely 5 points and 0 points.
117,130n53a_00118,"The fakery task was excellent and I'm glad the contestants had good ideas for it. Though of course I disagree with the scoring. The music task was a washout, sadly. It really needed someone to do it creatively and nobody tried to. They all ignored the bonus point for playing well. My instinct was that I'd try to make a tune, and that that would help me remember the sequence too."
118,130n53a_00119,"My general thoughts: - Prize Task: Solid stuff all around. Standard Prize Task antics. - Task 1: Lovely range of things. Performances, crafts, genuine fakery, and Frankie. His was the most Frankie Boyle thing he's done yet. - Task 2: Classic Taskmaster premise. Was getting a bit stale by the end, but then Kiell's attempt brought it back. From that point on, this episode was brutal. - Task 3: I remember before the series got going that Frankie and Ivo had the potential to be my favourite team on the show. They are living up. This was a great episode for Frankie. - Live Task: As much as I want to call this unfair, Ivo and Frankie had to opportunity to fight back, Ivo just realised too late, and Frankie didn't realise at all. Still, I think 10 whole points is a bit extreme. But I have a feeling Ivo and Frankie will rise back to their previous positions, because Kiell's still in this, and he's firmly in the position of series screw-up. This episode reminds me why I love the show, and it reminds me what I get out of this, is what people get out of sport. Fully invested. There was brilliance, there was controversy. It's good damn TV."
119,130n53a_00120,"I’m seeing a lot of negativity about this episode, everyone is entitled to their opinion of course but I thought it was lots of fun. I was crying laughing at Frankie and Ivos spoon task!"
120,130n53a_00121,"I'm honestly frustrated that one of the best tasks in YEARS got tainted by Greg's ludicrous subjective scoring. ""Fake something"" is such a brilliant open-ended concept for a task and having the most expected thing one could fake get 5 points because of a ""Frank is chubby"" gag is just.. ☠️☠️☠️ Jenny - 1, Frank - 2, Kiell - 3, Ivo/Mae - 4/5 (either way or 5 to both)."
121,130n53a_00122,"Fancying Mae Martin more and more with each episode, that eyebrow wiggling did something for me."
122,130n53a_00123,"There's a lot of people saying how unfair the task was for Frankie and Ivo, but to me it seems like there was an effort made to make it work in their favour. They were likely to lose the first part of the task since they only had two people, and then there was suddenly a second part of the task designed to trip up the winning team and make them lose their points, especially since the losing team could have tried to distract them. So despite losing the first part, Frankie and Ivo were in a strong position to win all the points, which is quite unfair to the team of three, but possibly balances out the fact that they had a larger team. All this would have worked out quite nicely, as long as the team of three doesn't miraculously get the right number at the end."
123,130n53a_00124,"There was something off about this episode, but the thing that bugs me the most is the ending. 2v3 going into the final task the team of 3 with an obvious advantage with that task since there's 2 people trying to put stuff in the suit while it was only frankie alone having to put double the amount in. Same goes for taking it out. Then there's the fact he took his hands of his head and helped remove the stuff which counters the first part of the task of not removing your hands AT ALL which was specified in the task. Just something about it feels wrong."
124,130n53a_00125,"One of the best episodes ever. Every task was an instant classic, Mae and Ivo’s faker tasks got rare reactions from Alex which was fun, and the spoons. Ivo going into the kitchen got me yelling at the tv. Just amazing. Perfect Taskmaster."
125,130n53a_00126,kiell why on EARTH would this specifically even occur to you
126,130n53a_00127,Kiell’s hand has made me howl with laughter I can’t cope
127,130n53a_00128,Ivo! That was excellent!
128,130n53a_00129,What a swerve from Ivo!
129,130n53a_00130,Ivo smashed that
130,130n53a_00131,ok Ivo wins that task
131,130n53a_00132,Horace and Boris 😂😂😅
132,130n53a_00133,"""Is this like an Alzheimer's test?"""
133,130n53a_00134,GREG WITH THE EPISODE TITLE!
134,130n53a_00135,"Lmfao he asked for another go, he deserves the points"
135,130n53a_00136,Kiell has the whiff of Kumar - first at being a legend
136,130n53a_00137,I'm waiting for another reveal that someone didn't use a magnet to get one of the spoons
137,130n53a_00138,Real father talking down to his son moment there.
138,130n53a_00139,This is Frankie/Ivo team dynamic I was expecting. 🤣 Utter shitshow.
139,130n53a_00140,"I’m a bit behind, but that spoon task was hilarious. My favourite task of the series so far"
140,130n53a_00141,I think we need a Juan Monroe III flair
141,130n53a_00142,I loved Alex's surprised expression during Ivo's attempt at the first task.
142,130n53a_00143,I'm convinced Frankie would make a excellent Taskmaster replacement with all these jokes. Scratch card joke after that team task was a perfect sendoff.
143,130n53a_00144,"The first task was absolutely hilarious, especially Frankie's and Ivo's (which I thought was worthy of getting 5 points) But man, that live task sucked. Big disadvantage of the duo because they have no control of the task. Still, it was an incredible episode and I still believe that Ivo and Frankie can still catch up to their current ranks."
144,130n53a_00145,The mummy fake out reminded me so much of the trick or treat task from NZ series 3 where most of the contestants don't realize the person in the costume isn't Paul.
145,130n53a_00146,"Another fun episode, the band task was a bit disappointing. Not much room for comedy with it or silliness, and even the editors realized they just had to cut and speed up the rest of the contestants."
146,130n53a_00147,Someone get Jenny some cheddar and cheddar
147,130n53a_00148,"""Ready, steady, go"" instead of ""Your time starts now"" seems 👀"
148,130n53a_00149,That scoring is almost as bad as the rabbits in a hat task that was worth literal points back in season 2 (or was it 3?)
149,130n53a_00150,Ivo's highest high and lowest low (arguably TM's highest/lowest as well) being in almost back-to-back tasks is peak Taskmaster
150,130n53a_00151,Ivo's delivery is so bloody good
151,130n53a_00152,The old switcheroo!
152,130n53a_00153,That was brilliant from Ivo
153,130n53a_00154,Gorgeous technique from Ivo there
154,130n53a_00155,I can't get the image of Frankie Boyle running in his underwear out my head
155,130n53a_00156,Jenny’s having another lovely day out!
156,130n53a_00157,This is quite possibly the most ridiculous live task ever...
157,130n53a_00158,Haha Ivo’s cheeky lil jump and kick
158,130n53a_00159,Those two tasks really screwed Ivo in the series
159,130n53a_00160,The scoring of Taskmaster is a joke
160,130n53a_00161,"I see the final task as more of a deception task, the team of two probably were never going to beat the team of three of putting in items, but it all comes down to the second part where you need to count how many items you put in. And at this point Ivo and Frankie could have interfered and distracted them further, maybe putting some of their items into Kiell to mess up the other teams counting method. The odds of getting the answer right isn't high unless you spot that Birthday Card with the number on it that only the team of two got (and probably could have even used if by some chance they won the first part.)"
161,130n53a_00162,That was excellent.
162,130n53a_00163,"For those interested in Ivo reviewing the three Steve Bruce novels (if you're an Ivo fan, you'll enjoy these episodes whether or not you're a football fan) - Podcast: ""Quickly Kevin; Will He Score?""

163,130n53a_00164,I like cheese and cash😂
164,130n53a_00165,"How was ""can you beat a baby"" not the title."
165,130n53a_00166,I am fucking loving how argumentative Frankie’s become in the studio.
166,130n53a_00167,I like cheese and cash. 🤣
167,130n53a_00168,Always annoying how Greg will award production work other than clever thinking like Ivo's and Mae's
168,130n53a_00169,"""Grope in the grass"" would've been my choice for episode title."
169,130n53a_00170,Could it be another 'Old goosebump arm' situation?
170,130n53a_00171,"Ugh, I came here to see people I've almost heard of screaming in a dark room, none of this rubbish."
171,130n53a_00172,Greg: “I can’t leave a baby on the bottom by itself.” Jenny: “No you can’t.” Greg: “Yes I can.”
172,130n53a_00173,Anyone else think Mae is overthinking prize tasks? (not a knock on them)
173,130n53a_00174,Didn't expect Kiell to completely own this task
174,130n53a_00175,🤣🤣 Kiell’s facial expressions make me die
175,130n53a_00176,"This was the most unfair episode so far , its all a joke obviously but it still irritated me lol"
176,130n53a_00177,I always think its a bit shit when they have the live task be a team task and put the people in first and second on the same team. Kiell was only one or two points behind Mae going into the live task but had zero chance of winning the episode.
177,130n53a_00178,"Ivo absolutely stitched Frankie up with that kitchen debacle, quality stuff."
178,130n53a_00179,"Absolutely loved the spoon task, the duo's attempt is probably my favourite task of the series yet, Frankie would make a great voice actor for Miss Battle-Axe in Horrid Henry and I absolutely lost it at ""you greedy bastard!"". The music task was also a lot of fun although I didn't feel like Nishing Kiell really had as much impact as, well, Nish. Haven't scrolled down fully yet but have already seen some comments complaining about the live task and I fully agree. I already don't like live team tasks to begin with, especially with an all-or-nothing stipulation, but it was even worse in this case as Mae was immediately guaranteed the win (at least when they did it in series 7 either James or Jessica could have won). The two part task just fucked things up even more; I'm glad Mae and Jenny actually got it right by counting rather than seeing the number on the card, but if it wasn't for Jenny still being series leader this could have been a rabbits-in-hats-level scoring disaster"
179,130n53a_00180,"About the one man band task: did the task say you can only have one try? IIRC it says ""longest sequence wins"", but not that you can have only one go at it. Unfortunately I can't check the exact wording right now..."
180,130n53a_00181,Heads off to Google “Steve Bruce detective novels”
181,130n53a_00182,Subtle middle finger on the glasses from Greg. Love it
182,130n53a_00183,That would have been even better if he was bollock naked
183,130n53a_00184,"Ivo’s ending was more clever, but I loved Frankie’s more."
184,130n53a_00185,"it's not often i see a task and immediately think i'd be awful at it, but this is 1000% one of them"
185,130n53a_00186,"""You look like Dick Van Dyke!"""
186,130n53a_00187,"Fuck me, I thought Kielle would smash it, but he really is smashing it!"
187,130n53a_00188,Damn I thought Kiell was actually good Plot twist af
188,130n53a_00189,"Throwgate last week, spoongate this week, idk if my heart can take another upset"
189,130n53a_00190,Well played Ivo on the hat
190,130n53a_00191,Fucking hell Ivo 😂
191,130n53a_00192,"""I've put all this clobber on, and I've become overwhelmed by the occasion."" -Ivo Graham doing the super posh UK version of the ""I've got too much fucking shit on me"" I Think You Should Leave sketch"
192,130n53a_00193,"Never tell Greg anything in confidence, Alex. How many times do we need to tell you?!"
193,130n53a_00194,"""Frankie can you beat a baby?"""
194,130n53a_00195,Frankie sounds like the queen
195,130n53a_00196,A true father and son relationship
196,130n53a_00197,I'm absolutely sure there was one of the spoons that kiell picked up with his hand not the magnet
197,130n53a_00198,God i'm gonna miss this series when it's over
198,130n53a_00199,"Can't help but think about the red toilet roll being on Kiell's boiler suit. Technically, there were 28 things in there."
199,130n53a_00200,Jenny did the most typical Bollywood death scene
200,130n53a_00201,he’s pulled a nish kumar
201,130n53a_00202,I really wanted to see the scratchcard get scratched.
202,130n53a_00203,"The wry look Greg gave Mae tonight really channeled his TV father Rik Mayhall. I couldn't believe how much he looked like Rik! Also, the Made in Swindon sticker killed me..:D"
203,130n53a_00204,"I like how many tasks there have been with musical instruments in the Taskonbury-themed season. Also between Kiell trying again at the musical Simon, Ivo betting it all on the kitchen spoons, and the tension Mae felt on the final guess, it is clear everyone wants to win (but, you know, with levity)."
204,130n53a_00205,"Another reason I'm not so bothered about the live task is that it put Kiell in third which helps even out the judging he's gotten. That's the thing with Taskmaster, someone might get a harsh time one episode and then the chaotic system works in their favour in another episode. That's why I can't get mad at it. On a side note, I'm sensing a weird undercurrent of people assuming Mae is getting special treatment and it's nagl. Jenny is pretty blatantly the one Greg has a soft spot for and is the one currently winning so I think people seriously need to relax. Mae is just incredibly competent and I think Greg respects that."
205,130n53a_00206,Does anyone else feel like Mae is being gifted the win? I can think of the last episode where Greg outright ignored the rules and gave the team of 3 a chance to double their points on a task where having 3 was a massive boost.
206,130n53a_00207,So that’s 4 paintings out of 5 for Frankie’s prize tasks so far.
207,130n53a_00208,"Alex’s smile at the advert break was so sweet, like he’s just enjoying doing the show"
208,130n53a_00209,Oh my god Frankie
209,130n53a_00210,Wonder if they could have just went to the kitchen?
210,130n53a_00211,Ivo flew too close to the sun...
211,130n53a_00212,A real father and son bonding experience there
212,130n53a_00213,...and Mae's pulled back the entirety of Jenny's series lead in one show.
213,130n53a_00214,"Everything But The Trolley, didn't they release a new album recently?"
214,130n53a_00215,Holy shit that was incredible I can't believe they got the number of items spot on
215,130n53a_00216,I was going to say giving a massive 2 points to ol cake hand was an absolute joke but it was surpassed by that ludicrous finish. Brilliant
216,130n53a_00217,"Fake something? First idea that popped into my mind was fake a heart attack. Just put on an Oscar-worthy performance. edit: I typed this out before I saw Jenny's performance, great mind thinks alike."
217,130n53a_00218,"I had an odd realization coming into this episode, that I had no memory whatsoever of the sense of the scoring thus far, considering it's almost halfway thru. I couldn't have told you where any of the five ranked with a gun to my head."
218,130n53a_00219,Mae making friends wherever they go
219,130n53a_00220,Is this the task from the cast reveal?
220,130n53a_00221,Dick Van Dyke is bossing this task
221,130n53a_00222,WHAT THE FUCK
222,130n53a_00223,Oh my god Mae! Get in there with that guess!
223,130n53a_00224,"Just to clarify since there seems to be some confusion - the team of three didn't get 15 points. They got 5 points for winning the task plus 5 bonus points guessing correctly, so 10 in all and 5 on top of what they would've gotten. It's not an insane jump from when this has been done before. The reason it hurt Ivo and Frankie so badly was because they'd just failed the spoon team task and missed out on 5 points."
224,130n53a_00225,Loving the name of Frankie’s crow
225,130n53a_00226,What I can't understand this series is why over every music task they've added background music. Makes it really hard to know what's going on sometimes
226,130n53a_00227,[sad honk noises]
227,130n53a_00228,It’s Knightmare!
228,130n53a_00229,Frankie's voice! 😂
229,130n53a_00230,Ivo flew too close to the sun
230,130n53a_00231,Mae brings in glasses again
231,130n53a_00232,Arnold Bartleby sounds like a name Noel Fielding would give one of his characters
232,130n53a_00233,1 point for the baby is justified
233,130n53a_00234,Frankie contemplating when harry met sally 🥰
234,130n53a_00235,Brb just gonna go watch Sally Phillips’ task again
235,130n53a_00236,My money was on Jenny going for the orgasm not Frankie’s When Harry Met Sally
236,130n53a_00237,A+ from Frankie
237,130n53a_00238,Jenny didn’t even try to defend herself
238,130n53a_00239,Flew too close to the sun/spoon
239,130n53a_00240,Taskmaster x Derren Brown
240,130n53a_00241,"First overall bad episode of the series I guess. It went by so quickly and surely the unfair final task left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Mae winning like this does not seem fair. I hope Jenny catches up to them, as now it just seems like another season where the winner is known by halfway point (Lou, Ed, Morgana and Dara for eg). Anyhoo, the show was fun but the point distibution was atrocious. Ivo knows how to shoot himself in the foot."
241,130n53a_00242,"Absolutely horrendous tasks this season that aren't fun to watch on telly. The music one, just so boring. Spoon one was entertaining with Frankie and Ivo, but you could just see Kiell couldn't give a damn and was frustrated and not in a fun way. And then the live task comes along with that weird scoring, oh dear. Hard when you've got the great Australian TM that blew it out of the water"
242,130n53a_00243,I love these threads so much aha. But how do people comment on the show so quickly while it’s on? I feel like I can’t take my eyes of the screen until the ad break in case I miss something
243,130n53a_00244,frankie brought art to a prize task? i'm shocked
244,130n53a_00245,Ivo's is a great call back
245,130n53a_00246,I like tasks with eggs.
246,130n53a_00247,"That’s a great first task idea. I love these open-ended single verb ones, they really give an insight into the contestants’ mentality."
247,130n53a_00248,"""Hello everybody - I'm Archie Bell and I'm also the Drells. We got a new song called 'Tighten Up', and this is the music you tighten up with!"""
248,130n53a_00249,Oh Kiell 💔
249,130n53a_00250,Poor Kiell
250,130n53a_00251,Team task as the final? So Mae already won the episode
251,130n53a_00252,Harsh marking compared to earlier in the episode! And I love him to bits but I think I saw Kiell collect a spoon with his hands towards the beginning of his team task
252,130n53a_00253,"For the fake something task I would've put my clothes on a mannequin, tied a watermelon to the mannequin, and then I would've thrown the mannequin off the roof to squash the melon, making it look like I've died."
253,130n53a_00254,"Great episode let down by mean spirited twists in faking Kiell doing well at the one man band task, and handing the team of three 10 points each. Seems like in these later seasons the producers have decided who they want and don't want to win and use the live tasks to manipulate the results"
254,130n53a_00255,"I'd actually forgotten an interview I'd seen pre-series saying something about Ivo being distracted while looking for spoons and ended up ruining a task his team would've won. Got genuinely caught up in it and that moment of going ""... what on Earth are you doing?"" ha"
255,130n53a_00256,I wonder what this TV show being moved to 9pm is like
256,130n53a_00257,“Old Honkfoot” has to be a Greg quote.
257,130n53a_00258,Nah I'm not having this from Jenny again
258,130n53a_00259,Aww grandma Jenny
259,130n53a_00260,"Some Ardal-esque needling there, love it"
260,130n53a_00261,I think Frankie’s still got some argument in him for Mae from last week.
261,130n53a_00262,Jenny’s face
262,130n53a_00263,Alex had a blank look on his face all of a sudden
263,130n53a_00264,"First ooh ma baby last series, now oh ma heart"
264,130n53a_00265,That was a high quality task and Kiell
265,130n53a_00266,Ivo is terrible😂😂makes me laugh so much
266,130n53a_00267,Noooooo
267,130n53a_00268,I’m not sure another team task is wise after that showing
268,130n53a_00269,OMG WHAT???
269,130n53a_00270,Ooh that’s a real shake up for the scores
270,130n53a_00271,"I really didn’t like that episode, to be fair. The regular solo tasks weren’t memorable, except Ivo’s surprise reveal during the fake task (with the one man band task just being really boring, which they clearly attempted to salvage by initially not showing Kjell’s proper attempt). The team task was fun, although the high pitched noises just became dreadful after a while. Would’ve been fun for only one team to have to do that, for example. But then having a studio team task with a very similar premise (one teammate is controlled by the others, need to stuff things in their pocket) is just very bad. Alex always says they’re trying to mix things up between the tasks, but that has been lacking multiple times this series so far. Don’t even get me started on the incredibly unfair second part and points distribution. I thought they tinkered with extra points a few years ago and then abandoned them because it resulted in very unfair results and series winners. Apparently not. And you can clearly see the comedian’s weren’t enjoying it either. No notable banter at all throughout the show. Can only get better from here I guess…"
271,130n53a_00272,"I don’t get why people are so riled about the “points gulf” when Greg could quite as easily next episode decide to give a random 10 points to someone? Or 5 to one and 0 to the rest, several times over. The points system isn’t and never has been rigid, and we’re only halfway through. It’s fine."
272,130n53a_00273,Sounds like another Jenny quote for the title.
273,130n53a_00274,"Powerful homoeroticism, I really enjoyed it."
274,130n53a_00275,"For a moment there, Jenny Eclair looked 100% like Bricktop"
275,130n53a_00276,YES IVO
276,130n53a_00277,I'll have what Frankie's having
277,130n53a_00278,"""The least worst"". Those are some relatively low expectations"
278,130n53a_00279,"Yes, Kiell!"
279,130n53a_00280,"Oh, now it's Knightmare!"
280,130n53a_00281,That was a brilliant episode
281,130n53a_00282,Mae really is psychic
282,130n53a_00283,"Stupid taskmaster crushes, let me be 🙈 Whatever has happened before the episode must have been really fun, because everyone seemed to have started in great spirits. Love to see that!"
283,130n53a_00284,"I'm not through the episode yet, but if anyone knows the jacket/t-shirt combo Kiell was rocking, please do not hesitate to let me know!"
284,130n53a_00285,Yet more art from Frankie...
285,130n53a_00286,The horseshoe makes it
286,130n53a_00287,This is such a great task!!
287,130n53a_00288,I don’t think anyone’s contacted Alex’s wife before. I love it I think more than the cold reading itself.
288,130n53a_00289,I did not predict to see that this season
289,130n53a_00290,Go kiell
290,130n53a_00291,Bahaha at least he was in on this one.
291,130n53a_00292,Time for father and son (Frankie and Ivo)!
292,130n53a_00293,Big style blindfolded
293,130n53a_00294,Get on your hands and knees and crawl. Wow.
294,130n53a_00295,This spoon task feels so wholesome :')
295,130n53a_00296,Oh no
296,130n53a_00297,I said 29!!!!
297,130n53a_00298,Mae should have faked winning something big on the scratchcard.
298,130n53a_00299,Why were they wearing helmets in the one man band task? Was it so they didn't kill themselves on the cymbals?
299,130n53a_00300,"Weird question, but does anyone know if it'll be on All4 at 9:00 too?"
300,130n53a_00301,"I really keep meaning to make a big compilation of all the times Greg has called something ""Old""... hoping this episode keeps that tradition up"
301,130n53a_00302,If this was Sweden or New Zealand it definitely would be the baby.
302,130n53a_00303,Jenny 😂😂😂
303,130n53a_00304,The trailer task!
304,130n53a_00305,"Okay, Kiell didn't own the task."
305,130n53a_00306,Oh fucking hell they've made a meal of it
306,130n53a_00307,Good evening everyone!
307,130n53a_00308,"Luckiest thing, so what painting will Frankie bring in this week?"
308,130n53a_00309,Guessing this is the one making music from the intro
309,130n53a_00310,[SPOONS CLANK]
310,130n53a_00311,I’m worried about the helmets

315,130n53a_00316,15 series in and Little Alex Horne writes a task in Comic Sans... a font that basically sums him up. 🤦‍♂️
316,130n53a_00317,anyone know the song that was playing while Mae and Frankie were doing their second task?
317,130n53a_00318,Loving Mae’s glasses
318,130n53a_00319,RIP.

320,130n53a_00321,"Simon, but with a one man* band. you know what I mean"
321,130n53a_00322,Jenny leading the series! :D Mae wins the episode! :D
322,130n53a_00323,Where's the taskmaster tablet!

0,13epy1e_00001,"As someone who cannot do any accents at all, I think I would have said Bäst i test and then try the weak argument that whilst it doesn't translate to Taskmaster, it is the show Taskmaster itself in a Swedish accent. That or butcher an imitation of the Muppets Swedish Chef, Taskyjerby."
1,13epy1e_00002,Was Kiell's 21 seconds a reference to the So Solid Crew?? Has to be..
2,13epy1e_00003,"Funniest episode so far for me personally, lots and lots of laugh out loud moments. It’s definitely not been my favourite series so far but it had the daunting task of following 14 which I just adored."
3,13epy1e_00004,Anyone know what shoes Kiell was wearing?
4,13epy1e_00005,Would rotating the pulper back and forth 360 degrees counted as rotations or do you think it would have been shot down and no rotations as it was back where it started? Seems like you could do that without moving the spot and get as many as you had time for.
5,13epy1e_00006,"Thank God for Ivo in the pulper task, I was about ready to write it off as one of the worst of all time, ""Stand on a spot and blindly spin an egg, with absolutely no sense of how much tolerance it has."" This series, they really love tasks where the contestants' ability to do anything is limited, and IDK why they like it, but it's stifling."
6,13epy1e_00007,"“I’ve already lost the episode, I just wanted to have a go at it” Brilliant, Ivo"
7,13epy1e_00008,Grip your head like a chimpanzee whose habitat is under threat fucking hell Frankie
8,13epy1e_00009,Taskmaster release the uncut Kiell footage you cowards
9,13epy1e_00010,"""Canada is generic America!"" Mae was about to throw hands!"
10,13epy1e_00011,"""It does make me feel quite sorry for you sometimes when you grip your head like a chimpanzee whose habitat is under threat."" What a fucking line from Frankie."
11,13epy1e_00012,every time I hear someone say 'I put it to you' I have flashbacks to Bridget
12,13epy1e_00013,RELEASE THE KIELL MONSTER OUTTAKES THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN
13,13epy1e_00014,i’m fucking CRYING that she realised in real time she didn’t clap
14,13epy1e_00015,Ivo sacrificing points just to do Jenny’s walk was pure gold!
15,13epy1e_00016,The build-your-own-task idea is genius
16,13epy1e_00017,i love that kiell owned being an absolute terror in that task lmao
17,13epy1e_00018,"Top tier episode. First one that genuinely had me laughing right the way through. Kiell, Ivo and Frankie incredible. Mae managed to raise 2 solid laughs with the pogo story and the Jenny walk 😘🤌 The inevitable outtakes of Kiell from the team task, give me that all night long. Massive return to form."
18,13epy1e_00019,Ivo making some great faces
19,13epy1e_00020,That looked like the moment Kiell realised that Charlotte Ritchie had fucked him over royally recommending he do taskmaster
20,13epy1e_00021,"This is fucking hilarious, Frankie just ignores him😂😂"
21,13epy1e_00022,"When they first showed the inside of the pulper, I thought it was that the egg would never break no matter how many times they turned the wheel, and the trick was that whoever had the confidence to last the longest would win"
22,13epy1e_00023,"Ivo’s choice to do another ‘Jenny’ walk and throw his turn was the funniest point of this series, really got me chuckling. Enjoying this series but it’s 7 episodes in and it’s not proving as memorable as I’d hoped for."
23,13epy1e_00024,"The deeply sinister way Frankie refers to ""the children"" brings me such joy every time he says it. His household must be so delightfully weird."
24,13epy1e_00025,“i’ve been arrested obviously but i haven’t done sex games” JENNY 💀
25,13epy1e_00026,Imagine if Bridget had been part of the walking round 😂😂😂
26,13epy1e_00027,KIELL GAVE HIMSELF 1 MINUTE AND 21 SECONDS I CANT WAIT
27,13epy1e_00028,Such a shame that ‘A Chimpanzee whose habitat is under threat’ is too long for an episode title
28,13epy1e_00029,Ivo is a master of 'I think you're absolutely mental and wrong but I'm not actually going to tell you.'
29,13epy1e_00030,Frankie comparing it to a plane crash...
30,13epy1e_00031,I don’t think I fucking clapped
31,13epy1e_00032,"God, we've all been focusing so much on Kiell's 1 min 21 seconds we forgot Frankie had 2 minutes to clap 50 times."
32,13epy1e_00033,"""Street tough"" Ivo showing his inner Wozniak!"
33,13epy1e_00034,Oh fucking hell Mae that was dead on
34,13epy1e_00035,ivo just wanting to join in 😂
35,13epy1e_00036,"Honestly I'm really glad Mae's coming out of their shell a bit. The last few episodes they've seemed a lot more outgoing and it's easier to see their sense of humour shining through. Great episode all around. Great tasks, nice combination of approaches, everyone got their moment to shine. I'm still rooting for a Jenny win, though."
36,13epy1e_00037,Feeling deeply hurt by Greg's comment about couples who let their dogs sleep in the bed. Guess I'll have time to think about it tonight while lying on my quarter of the bed.
37,13epy1e_00038,"“I'm not gonna win anyway!” That's the spirit, Jenny!"
38,13epy1e_00039,"""Eat with caution and milk"" Another alternate episode title"
39,13epy1e_00040,"Great episode where all of them had top moments. Mae’s Jenni impression, Kiell’s cheeky stealing of gold pen, Frankie’s chimpanzee analogy, another classic Ivo with head in hands moment after a complete melt down, and Jenni despairing at her lack of clapping. I love how Ivo seems to either come up with some genius lateral thinking to ace task (task one) or completely panic and fall to pieces. Ivo’s and Frankie’s odd couple routine continues to be comedy gold. Last time it was Ivo getting drawn towards kitchen despite Frankie’s high-pitched protestations, and today it was Ivo having to put Frankie right."
40,13epy1e_00041,Ivo's sudden delivery of CANNELLINI BEANS was a perfect moment.
41,13epy1e_00042,"""Just bounce around with your friends"", duh❤️ When Frankie brought up the co-pilot thing, it reminded me of Cabin Pressure: Hey chief, I might be wrong, but ... Ivo was going for Mae's Mickey Mouse voice from the spoon task, right? Very resourceful of him, shame it didn't pay off."
42,13epy1e_00043,"""I think there was immense dignity in watching my body spasm with a gloved egg in my mouth."" Ivo creates new sentences every day. I did not understand that periodic table task at all. I would have been exactly like Kiell: ""What I will say is, that has been edited very, very nicely in my favor. Because I was a monster in that room."" (Who else wanted to see that edit?) The Mad Libs task was clever, but I really felt Ivo's frustration when he started losing it with the duck. Frankie: ""It does make me feel quite sorry for you sometimes when you grip your head like a chimpanzee whose habitat is under threat."" Alex: ""All I could do, surely, was lick your duck."" 👀 Loved this moment of Ivo cracking up to Jenny's ""Tashkmashter"": That live task redeemed the whole episode for me. Especially Jenny having a stroke while doing her ""Newcastle"" accent. And those ""poor Jenny"" walks. ""When does this cross into bullying?"" Ivo: ""I've already lost the episode, I just wanted to have a go at it."" 😂 It's too bad no one got to do a Greg walk."
43,13epy1e_00044,"As a Canadian, I'm glad Mae stood up to Alex's comment about Canada being generic America... although Ivo did do a pretty accurate accent, lol"
44,13epy1e_00045,frankie seems like he is constantly at war with his children and i love that energy for him
45,13epy1e_00046,"I love Frankie, but he keeps getting overscored on prize tasks. Ivo was robbed (again), and Kiell should have been higher, too."
46,13epy1e_00047,Is Disney a country ?
47,13epy1e_00048,"""Like a chimpanzee whose habitat is under threat"" 😂😂😂"
48,13epy1e_00049,"Ivo throwing the final round to have a go at a Jenny walk made me laugh the most this series. Poor Jenny, lol."
49,13epy1e_00050,So I guess going clockwise and then anticlockwise you could keep the basket with the egg in the same spot?
50,13epy1e_00051,Ivo is out of thicko corner!
51,13epy1e_00052,jenny has cooked something holy shit that’s such nanna energy
52,13epy1e_00053,"Absolutely loved Jenny's breakdown about not clapping, and Ivo throwing the studio task. Great moments. The escape room team task looked really fun. I would love to do that in person."
53,13epy1e_00054,"Never have I more sympathized with a contestant than with Ivo's frustration at Frankie insistently doing the code incorrectly. My wife I love playing escape games, and we *dread* when a room doesn't allow private bookings - inevitably, we're paired up with someone who has never done an escape room but is SUPER confident that they know exactly how to solve a puzzle. It's so so frustrating."
54,13epy1e_00055,I was already in tears at Ivo’s task and then Frankie’s comment utterly broke me.
55,13epy1e_00056,"I think this was the best episode of the series! I loved every task. I have lightly criticized Mae in the past for being a bit bland but I loved them in this episode. First lateral thinking solution in awhile, too."
56,13epy1e_00057,They all did the second part of the live task wrong. They should have said “Lord Gregory Daniel Davies”.
57,13epy1e_00058,Kiell contributing at a John Kearns level for a team task
58,13epy1e_00059,Even Jennie knew it was her😂
59,13epy1e_00060,"""All I could do, surely, was lick your duck."" Great out-of-context Taskmaster quote"
60,13epy1e_00061,"Gosh I never would have expected myself to love Jenny Eclair this much. She never fails to make me laugh! Hilarious without even trying! Also, Ivo throwing points at the live task by doing Jenny's walk is very Ivo. Ahaha. Quite unexpected, but not surprising. So happy Kiell won! Now, I'm hoping Frankie would get a win too so all of them are at least an episode winner."
61,13epy1e_00062,42 FUCKING MINUTES 😂😂😂😂😂
62,13epy1e_00063,"""Lick your duck"" Another alternate episode title"
63,13epy1e_00064,"""I don't think the squat is relevant"" another title contender there"
64,13epy1e_00065,WHAT A SWERVE FROM IVO
65,13epy1e_00066,kiell needed this. for his soul
66,13epy1e_00067,"Finally the episode went to see being recorded was screened. Random bits I remember from the recording. There was quite a debate about whether a pogo stick was actually a pop up thing or not. Frankie managed to start a chat about fascists after one of Alex's timing methods referenced a band who Frankie said were actually fascists, this was quite a discussion and was even a link to one of the ad breaks. There was a much longer discussion about Kiel refusing to eat any of the jelly babies and just licking one or two."
67,13epy1e_00068,The Kiell redemption arc starts now!
68,13epy1e_00069,"Alternate episode titles: ""Guff-and-cup system."" ""A Victorian satellite."" ""A feisty French duck."" ""Taste of Africa."""
69,13epy1e_00070,I liked that the egg would get destroyed after a dozen turns.
70,13epy1e_00071,At this point I'm predicting Ivo's going to be left alone in tasks.
71,13epy1e_00072,"If Ivo drops the egg now, I swear"
72,13epy1e_00073,I'm not 100% sure... but I think Ivo may have fucked it.
73,13epy1e_00074,Is Ivo having a breakdown?
74,13epy1e_00075,Too many tasks in modern Taskmaster start where it's not clear what's actually going on. It works here given the contestants don't have a scooby either but we the viewer don't get the same senses they do
75,13epy1e_00076,"Great episode. One of my favourites of the season, which I think has been really fun overall even if it’s not quite TM at its best. Everyone has brought something unique from previous contestants, especially Ivo with his chaotic self doubt and the curse of politeness. He’s one of the best we’ve seen on the show imo."
76,13epy1e_00077,this episode was such fun! loved the live task
77,13epy1e_00078,So glad Kiell won a show!!!
78,13epy1e_00079,Those people calling for the Kiell monster outtakes may change their mind if he comes across like Iain Stirling in the hammock task! Maybe it was edited like it was for his own benefit
79,13epy1e_00080,How did Frankie's painting get 5 points?!
80,13epy1e_00081,"Kiell's kinda bringing some Ian Sterling 'I ain't having this' energy to the group tasks, haha."
81,13epy1e_00082,"As someone who’s enjoyed Mae, but not really seen them as as entertaining as the other four, “Mr. And Mrs. Egg-Pulper” and the accompanying voices were a lovely change of pace. They’re good quality, Mae is."
82,13epy1e_00083,"""I suffer as we all shall at the hands of the bat!"""
83,13epy1e_00084,You love adding these numbers together
84,13epy1e_00085,"Alex, how long did they spend doing the code and how long looking for key? I want stats!"
85,13epy1e_00086,Ivo and Desiree would make a great pair
86,13epy1e_00087,Of course Kiell stole the gold pen!
87,13epy1e_00088,Ivo's duck has SEEN things. TERRIBLE things.
88,13epy1e_00089,"There we go, the episodic Frankie smackdown zinger"
89,13epy1e_00090,What's showing that it's a dog? OUCH
90,13epy1e_00091,Has anyone seen my gold pen?
91,13epy1e_00092,Hahaha fucking hell Ivo!
92,13epy1e_00093,That was a great live task.
93,13epy1e_00094,Ivo wanting to join in doing the Jenny walk is amazing but I woulda loved to see him trying to copy his father's hands walk
94,13epy1e_00095,"I'm so glad Kiell won the episode. Mainly because the way he's taken on board being the picked on loser role has been great, especially the way he seems spot on with how and when he bites on Greg's picking at him. But just a little bit because Alex did him dirty on the pulp the egg task. He clearly asked Alex if he could see the egg and was told he wasn't allowed to see it. Yet Alex didn't stop Ivo from shuffling around because they weren't allowed to see it - so different rules being applied there."
95,13epy1e_00096,"Was going to say that's the worst attempt at a Swedish accent I've ever heard. But it got slightly overshadowed by the Newcastle attempt.. Fun episode, really liked the randomness of the fourth task."
96,13epy1e_00097,"That egg task was brilliantly devious. Loved how Ivo thought outside of the box, haven't seen that much this season."
97,13epy1e_00098,"Stop saying 42 is the meaning of life. It’s not the meaning of life, it’s the ultimate answer!"
98,13epy1e_00099,"Ivo may not have won the episode, but he won our hearts! (Again!) Well deserved win by Kiell! So happy he finally won! His bench deserved those 5 points. This is the first episode in a few where I've liked every task and agreed with the scoring, except the prize task."
99,13epy1e_00100,I'd pay to visit an art museum full of the fucking mental stuff Frankie has brought in this series
100,13epy1e_00101,Kiell makes the best faces
101,13epy1e_00102,Ivo has been singled out again lmao
102,13epy1e_00103,ivo you fucking genuis
103,13epy1e_00104,"""It's gone a bit S&My!"""
104,13epy1e_00105,"Either the live task is super long, or this is one of the shortest episodes of taskmaster in history. Feels so brief!"
105,13epy1e_00106,"Did Frankie really say ""not for me baby"" about the hug or am i hallucinating"
106,13epy1e_00107,"I wonder what would have happened if the basket fell, but the egg didn't break. Ivo was so polite during the team task. <3"
107,13epy1e_00108,Ivo’s face represents how I have felt doing every escape room ever.
108,13epy1e_00109,"Oh, fuck it! PULP THE EGG!"
109,13epy1e_00110,Why does Frankie have so much weird art?
110,13epy1e_00111,Release the Kiell cut!
111,13epy1e_00112,"Oh my god, the analogy, Ivo’s face, 42 fucking minutes!!!"
112,13epy1e_00113,"As per Team Ivo, I'd love a win out of nowhere"
113,13epy1e_00114,This might be one of the more bizarre tasks in 15 series
114,13epy1e_00115,Ivo's bossed it for once!
115,13epy1e_00116,Toe off the spot replay coming
116,13epy1e_00117,Frankie and Ivo's is going to be an absolute shitshow hahahahaha
117,13epy1e_00118,you love adding those numbers together 😃
118,13epy1e_00119,completely ignoring Liza in the HOPS task vibe
119,13epy1e_00120,The Ivo panic ❤️
120,13epy1e_00121,Bad Greg. I would have guessed New Zealand
121,13epy1e_00122,Well this is gonna turn racist real quick😂😂
122,13epy1e_00123,Ivo you superstar!!!
123,13epy1e_00124,Oh bless Jenny LOL
124,13epy1e_00125,Frankie having to do a Belfast accent at the end when he's a Celtic fan was 100% deliberately to wind him up 😂 Fab episode. I adore Ivo more and more each week - I was like a proud Mama when he aced the first task
125,13epy1e_00126,I know not to invite Frankie and Ivo to do an escape room.
126,13epy1e_00127,"I was not expecting this episode to turn into a discussion of crew resource management, but, then, Frankie's been taking this series in interesting directions since the beginning."
127,13epy1e_00128,"Loved the live task. The country round was so unfortunate, like three times Greg got close. Looks like Mae has a pretty commanding lead (15 points), which is fair because they're the most competent, but Kiell somehow being second in the series after being the picked-on guy is pretty funny. Frankie, for as much as he's been just having a good time, could be right up there had he not been lumbered with Ivo (and disadvantaged by being in the team of two). Instead he's 4th."
128,13epy1e_00129,"I'm going to split a hair, but no one should have been disqualified from the egg task. The exact wording of the task was ""if you PULP the egg you are disqualified."" All three of the contestants whose eggs broke, broke due to smashing on the ground, not being pulped."
129,13epy1e_00130,How many times now has Frankie brought a painting in for the prize task?
130,13epy1e_00131,Alex looked so happy on Kiell's pogo stick
131,13epy1e_00132,"""Floury Scottish Dog"" Another alternate episode title"
132,13epy1e_00133,Now that Kiell emphasized it...we need for the official TM YT channel to post the outtakes of the trio's team task!
133,13epy1e_00134,Greg keeps giving Frankie 5s for things I'd give 1s..
134,13epy1e_00135,"One full rotation left, one full rotation right, repeat. Infinite pulping."
135,13epy1e_00136,"So the MOMENT I heard the instructions for the cooking task I knew that it would be ""make the thing you just described, in the time you chose"". I paused and went: 20 minutes (give yourself maximum time) 50 (can't be sure whether the number will be good or bad) Smoked salmon, eggs, caviar, champagne, bread Delicious English Breakfast I would have then shared a lovely cooked breakfast (poached eggs with salmon on toast) with Alex - its Englishness is verified by it being prepared by an Englishman, and if anyone says it isn't sufficiently English I'll just say that it's very English to me, an upper middle class white man, also I wanted to enjoy a nice bottle of champagne with Alex. I'd only lose if I miscounted my claps, did an extra clap accidentally, or botched the poaching of the eggs."
136,13epy1e_00137,Hmm so a test of their blind confidence then? Okay. I feel like the editors are doing more heavy lifting with this one.
137,13epy1e_00138,No way are father and son doing that well
138,13epy1e_00139,"THE KEY IS RIGHT THERE, LADS!"
139,13epy1e_00140,I hope they all have Jennie
140,13epy1e_00141,mae nailed jenny
141,13epy1e_00142,Kiell won a show I’m so happy
142,13epy1e_00143,"After 2 below average episodes this one was great, 3 great filmed tasks and one of the best live tasks in a long time"
143,13epy1e_00144,"Nutella biscuits look pretty good tbf, but I have a bag of jelly babies on the go"
144,13epy1e_00145,Was waiting for Ivo to somehow still bugger that up after shimmying so gracefully
145,13epy1e_00146,"I appreciate the quick and lateral thinking in this episode, but I think they've taken a bit too much control away from the contestants. Aside from Ivo's good lateral thinking, the pulper was pretty much purely random. The mad lib task was highly random. Thankfully the team task rewarded some cleverness and the studio task was pretty much perfect."
146,13epy1e_00147,Painting did not deserve 5 wtf
147,13epy1e_00148,"kiell, the great pen theif"
148,13epy1e_00149,Surely they knew the time would come back to bite them. Why did they pick such small times!!
149,13epy1e_00150,"Bwhaha Ivo's ""Taskmaster""."
150,13epy1e_00151,"Geordie Eclair is guilty of some absolutely inexcusable Walter Gropius erasure, and I am simply not having it."
151,13epy1e_00152,Ivo wearing a Public Service Broadcasting t-shirt :)
152,13epy1e_00153,EDIT: Ah shit... Am I really going to end up buying it now I found it? Lol
153,13epy1e_00154,This egg pulping task feels a bit arbitrary? Like there's no different way to approach it other than turning and wait?
154,13epy1e_00155,> gets the first one wrong Well this is going to go well.
155,13epy1e_00156,"With Kiell going for such a low number compared to the rest, he's either fucked it or smashed it with no way of finding out until the second part."
156,13epy1e_00157,kiell is so happy he got a 5 for once
157,13epy1e_00158,Is this the start of the Kiell victory arc?!
158,13epy1e_00159,Ohhh I really want Kiell to win just to see his little face!
159,13epy1e_00160,"I mean Disney lore is so big, it probably could have it’s own sub-accent"
160,13epy1e_00161,Live task saved that episode for me. The walk was brilliant.
161,13epy1e_00162,"For the build your own task, I would've gone with 50 and 10 minutes because I would've been so scared to fuck myself over going either extreme, I think. Don't know if it would've gone well but might've at least given me a chance. I really like the tasks where the contestants get to dig their own graves. The live task seemed like it had potential but was a bit underwhelming. Not a bad episode, though, enjoyed the tasks overall. I wish Alex had told us how long Ivo and Frankie spent looking for the handcuff key hanging in plain sight, that was very relatable and felt like quite a while."
162,13epy1e_00163,I loves that Ivo and Jenny wearing the same sneakers 🫶🏼
163,13epy1e_00164,"I know literally everyone would hate me for it, but nothing in the rules against walking behind Mae before attempting a Canadian accent."
164,13epy1e_00165,Is Frankie opening an art gallery?
165,13epy1e_00166,"Captain After The Ad Break is back again, I see."
166,13epy1e_00167,The Eton education pays off
167,13epy1e_00168,Father and son have the joint-lead!
168,13epy1e_00169,Jenny thrilled at some S&M. Lol
169,13epy1e_00170,Kiell licking the jelly-baby...😂
170,13epy1e_00171,Gonna need a gif of that realization by Ivo. LOL
171,13epy1e_00172,Oh my God Ivo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
172,13epy1e_00173,"""Describe your break in one word."" ""Plop."""
173,13epy1e_00174,"Of all of those three, I didn't expect Jenny to be the one to fuck it!"
174,13epy1e_00175,Justice for the weird hot dog bench
175,13epy1e_00176,"Finally, Kiell Smith Kumar wins an episode!!"
176,13epy1e_00177,"Oh nice, Ivo's got a Public Service Broadcasting shirt on!"
177,13epy1e_00178,kiell being a mood as always 😂
178,13epy1e_00179,FRANKIE WITH THE EPISODE TITLE
179,13epy1e_00180,"Said nothing about directions, you could just turn it one way then the other"
180,13epy1e_00181,shout out to Ivo and his Public Service Broadcasting band t shirt
181,13epy1e_00182,Christ that was a short section between ad breaks!
182,13epy1e_00183,The contrast between Mae and Ivo
183,13epy1e_00184,The gold fucking shoe!
184,13epy1e_00185,"I wrote down my answers to see if I would have fucked myself over, and I would have nailed that task. 3; 14 minutes; flour, egg, milk, sugar, red food colouring; Japan; flag; pretty. Once I wrote down ""red food colouring"" I thought ""Oh I might need to make the flag of the nationality!"" so went Japan. Then saw the noun and went ""well I'll choose flag since that's what I thought it would be"". And then I wouldn't have realised I'd have to cook it so I would have served raw moosh in a very pretty Japanese flag image."
185,13epy1e_00186,"Massive, MASSIVE props to Ivo wearing Public Service Broadcasting's 'Go!' t-shirt. Check the band out on Spotify, it's lovely <3"
186,13epy1e_00187,Where has Alex secretly taped the code do we think? Bottom of the glasses..?
187,13epy1e_00188,Lmfao I love this shitshow.
188,13epy1e_00189,"Oh god, Ivo"
189,13epy1e_00190,Lol @ Ivo chimp
190,13epy1e_00191,"KIELL WINS THE EPISODE! I'm not sure how, but he has!"
191,13epy1e_00192,Wac a Mole needs 5 points
192,13epy1e_00193,Alex on the pogo stick cleared my acne
193,13epy1e_00194,And Frankie brought in another painting...
194,13epy1e_00195,FUCKING HELL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
195,13epy1e_00196,Hot dog bench seems easy though to be fair. Keill might have a chance
196,13epy1e_00197,does everyone have jenny?!?! 💀
197,13epy1e_00198,Who else is going to have a go at Jenny's walk today? I might even tell a passer by to pulp the egg.
198,13epy1e_00199,"Feeling for Frankie, can't buy a win. Despite him being one of the most successful prize task contestants"
199,13epy1e_00200,"Full of cold on top of a rubbish week, happy to be back with you all for another ep of TM and some laughter"
200,13epy1e_00201,That's a cool book
201,13epy1e_00202,Pogo stick feels like another one the production team may have helped with. Kiall got a lot of of the gag though tbf to him
202,13epy1e_00203,Frankie said it!
203,13epy1e_00204,So Ivo's going to be last again...which means he probably fucked up the task.
204,13epy1e_00205,IVO WHAT ARE YOU DOING 😂😂😂
205,13epy1e_00206,Please don't have fucked it ivo
206,13epy1e_00207,I THINK IT MIGHT BE CHICKEN FEET
207,13epy1e_00208,Kiell being the voice of reason here
208,13epy1e_00209,"Wonder if Kiell did this following his Off Menu episode, ah"
209,13epy1e_00210,Kiell avoiding eating any jelly babies
210,13epy1e_00211,Ivo just gives Alex the rubber duck! 😂
211,13epy1e_00212,But who did the best Jenny walk?
212,13epy1e_00213,he got me with the frankie boyle switcharoo. i would have bet that was about kiell.
213,13epy1e_00214,I hope someone has bought a jack-in-the-box Greg
214,13epy1e_00215,I want Ivo’s prize
215,13epy1e_00216,Jenny coming in left field with Schlemmer
216,13epy1e_00217,Clever boy!
217,13epy1e_00218,"Feels like a create a character in a video game, Ivo appearing in the cut-scene Mae is normally in"
218,13epy1e_00219,"Ooo, it was 157 I think. Was the last shot of the title sequence. EDIT: aw shit 5 digit code."
219,13epy1e_00220,"""I'm going to eat a jelly baby"" Instant regret. Haha!"
220,13epy1e_00221,Kiell’s gonna be totally fucked isn’t he
221,13epy1e_00222,Ya Bellend 😂
222,13epy1e_00223,"Channel 4's adverts have gone very region-specific in the weirdest way recently, I'm getting infomercials about Thames Waters' renewal projects, which would be great...if I didn't live 460 miles north..."
223,13epy1e_00224,I want that mole game.
224,13epy1e_00225,Is that bird shit on Kiells hat?
225,13epy1e_00226,I can’t follow this at all.
226,13epy1e_00227,I'm sure you could reach that key with your mouth rather than reaching with the hands
227,13epy1e_00228,Oh my god Frankie
228,13epy1e_00229,"As expected, Frankie and Ivo is making a bit of a mess of this."
229,13epy1e_00230,jenny doesn’t even know what she did there
230,13epy1e_00231,"As ever, whose title is it this week? My guess is either Frankie or Mae."
231,13epy1e_00232,"Ah, a Prof. Brian Cox Pop Tart"
232,13epy1e_00233,“vaguely as Brian Cox”
233,13epy1e_00234,"Of course Frankie brought another painting. How many of his prizes is that now? You can't argue it doesn't work, though!"
234,13epy1e_00235,Prediction: Frankie and Ivo do really well. They’re both very smart.
235,13epy1e_00236,Best task for ages! 👍😂😂
236,13epy1e_00237,[MANIACALLY]
237,13epy1e_00238,Yes Kiell!!
238,13epy1e_00239,"When Frankie brings the dog out and Alex asks, “It’s not really an eating situation is it?” he sounds like a completely different person to me. I had to rewind because I thought someone off-camera had said it. Am I crazy or did anyone else notice the difference of his voice?"
239,13epy1e_00240,Is there a poll/wager game this week? I no longer see the tab on the root page.
240,13epy1e_00241,"""Guff and cup system"" An early contender for the alternate episode title"
241,13epy1e_00242,Little bit cringe there
242,13epy1e_00243,Go Ivo
243,13epy1e_00244,Father and son duo are back
244,13epy1e_00245,UMMMM
245,13epy1e_00246,Someone should do a count of how many times they've gone straight to the task after the intro this series
246,13epy1e_00247,How is Kiell fucking up making a hot dog!? It already looks like a bench!
247,13epy1e_00248,
248,13epy1e_00249,No Way!
249,13epy1e_00250,Irish legend
250,13epy1e_00251,I cant tell if during the prize task Mae was trying to back up Jenny or if they were about to berate it
251,13epy1e_00252,who said the episode title this time?
252,13epy1e_00253,In before Mae wins the episode
253,13epy1e_00254,The tongue skit was a bit weak
254,13epy1e_00255,Ok that's a good one Mae
255,13epy1e_00256,Did things just rewind and speed forward or was that a weird All 4 issue?
256,13epy1e_00257,Even money on who bought the toaster in...
257,13epy1e_00258,Frankie with yet another painting 😂
258,13epy1e_00259,what the fuck was that tesco ad guys
259,13epy1e_00260,The man has absolutely smashed it
260,13epy1e_00261,Frankie and Ivo don’t look confident
261,13epy1e_00262,Fucking hell 😂
262,13epy1e_00263,
263,13epy1e_00264,Did ivo clap?
264,13epy1e_00265,Am I crazy for thinking that Mae sort of looks and acts like Brian Cox?
265,13epy1e_00266,For the pop up prize task I would of brought a sexy single in my Area. Is Nigella still single? Would of tried to get her.
266,13epy1e_00267,Shame Dara wasn’t in this episode
267,13epy1e_00268,Yes Kiell!!!!
268,13epy1e_00269,What’s the series score now?
269,13epy1e_00270,
270,13epy1e_00271,
271,13epy1e_00272,
272,13epy1e_00273,Does Ivo have ADHD? seems like he is constantly masking hyperactivey in the studio.
273,13epy1e_00274,Im pretty sure cowering is a verb not an adjective
274,13epy1e_00275,"Regarding the prize task...yes, I understand what Frankie is saying. However, in whatever was edited out, there was absolutely nothing there for Greg to give him the 5 points compared to the other prizes. Regarding the live task...was the point for Greg to guess correctly or incorrectly to get points. I didn't follow that. I am chuffed that Kiell finally won an episode. Edit: Re: Brian Cox - literraly the only thing I know him from is Super Troopers and it's sequel, even though I did see Braveheart, The Long Kiss Goodnight, and An Adventure in Space and Time"

0,8w4pg7_00001,"It was pretty funny, but what the fuck was the reasoning behind the cake thing? ""Express your love for Greg""- I'm gonna make Alex sit arse naked on a cake! What?"
1,8w4pg7_00002,Anyone else feel the challenges in this season where rather disappointing?
2,8w4pg7_00003,greg seemed sad this episode :(
3,8w4pg7_00004,"It was still good, I don't think the show is any danger of loosing its steam...but there was that one episode this season that I didn't enjoy much. I'm fucked if I can remember the exact episode now, but it was about 5 eps ago and was an episode chock full of really abstract entirely open to interpretation tasks that made the show look like crap improv more than anything. And fwiw, I think they should absolutely have some set tasks they repeat every year. I want to say the red green task should remain, but then Katherine Ryan sort of ruined that one so I guess its not gonna be entirely fair anymore....but something with a defined goal is always good."
4,8w4pg7_00005,
0,9d67ct_00001,"Loved it!!! Laughed all the way through. James Acaster - 'I know its early days, but are we the stupidest yet?'"
1,9d67ct_00002,"When Greg addresses James' tower, he definitely slipped into teacher mode"
2,9d67ct_00003,"I'm sure this has been mentioned before, but I just noticed every series has the competitors seated in alphabetical order by first name. That is so perfectly an Alex Horne thing to do."
3,9d67ct_00004,"Acaster's fruit hat technique had me rolling on the floor laughing. Sigh, a long ol' week again."
4,9d67ct_00005,"i nearly died laughing in the last task when it went across Kerry, Jess, Rhod and Phil helping each other out, to James Scrambling around trying to pick up one piece of fruit."
5,9d67ct_00006,I guess we know the role James Acaster is going to play... love that guy
6,9d67ct_00007,The thing that I noticed straightaway when the bean task was set that they used circumference (only for circles) instead of perimeter (which I think would be more accurate since the caravan is not a circular object). So if you want to be a smart arse then the circumference is actually 0cm but the perimeter is the one that they gave in the show.
7,9d67ct_00008,https://i.imgur.com/Z1JLILL.png https://i.imgur.com/cB5L561.png I don't think there's any coincidence in this.
8,9d67ct_00009,I think in this episode Kerry exposed herself as being a lot sharper than her general persona would lead you to believe. Little things like how she immediately thought to measure her handspand in the bean task takes a very quick mind to come up with.
9,9d67ct_00010,"Great fun all the way through, feeling positive for the coming weeks. It's even given me enough of a boost to go and cut the sodding lawn. I won't enjoy it but now I'll have something good to think about."
10,9d67ct_00011,"Rhod bringing the controversy hard in the very first episode: The philosophical conundrum of the costume of Theseus. Is juice a structural component of a bean? - instead of arguing about juice, (which is clearly not part of a bean), he should have demanded bean portrait measurements, not bean landscape. Also a joy to see a master showing us all the correct fruit stacking stance."
11,9d67ct_00012,I liked the first episode. I feel like these contestants are going to be quite different that the other seasons. I can't wait to see Phil and Rhod's interaction. In fact I bet both of them will also have some funny arguments with Greg- that they will loose. They have already shown they are willing to argue their case. I think James is going to give us some taskmaster gold- hes definitely the wildcard in my book! I wonder how they will divide them on the group tasks? I am guessing Kerry and Rhod and the younger 3 as the other group.
12,9d67ct_00013,"Loved the episode but the fruit task at the end bothered me. Surely Rhod should have got Phil's points and vice versa, same with Kerry and Jess? They did each others fruit displays so they should have got the points for the display they made."
13,9d67ct_00014,It sounded like Rod was saying he did tape measure circumference TIMES bean length. I suck at math but shouldn't it be divided by instead of times? I feel like that's why he was off.
14,9d67ct_00015,"If I'm honest, the only one I recognise was Rhod and had to Google the others beforehand so I'm still feeling my way around their comedy styles. Still, had a good time."
15,9d67ct_00016,"Everyone who liked the ep, go give it a big 10 on imdb:)"
16,9d67ct_00017,Your welcome.
0,9dg920_00001,Greg's disgusted look and 'how dare you speak' was the highlight for me. He properly activated teacher mode in that moment!
1,9dg920_00002,"I was at the taping of this episode I'm just impressed they got something cohesive, it was that madcap! The fact that the 'cumtorch' bit got cut was... predicted, but fucking hell it was good. Rhod talked about how you needed a blacklight to see Phil's circle, but you didn't wanna do that because you might see undesirable things on his onesie. This then broke Greg, who would say it during every transition, getting told of each time. I think it took ten takes to do one of them at one point. The live task was deathly silent in filming, because we were hyper-focused on the towers. Then one brave soul yelled ""CUMTORCH"" and Greg broke again. I see they fixed that by drowning it out as best they could. This was a wild ride. I loved it."
2,9dg920_00003,"It's got to be between Kerry and Rhod for this series having watched two episodes now. Kerry seems to stumble on to the best way to win a task but Rhod has a competitive nature which I like. The competitiveness wasn't really there last series, this one reminds me a bit of the very first series with the bickering of the panel, which wasn't there much at all really"
3,9dg920_00004,I simply cannot get over Phil's genitals.
4,9dg920_00005,Kerry's won twice in a row Get the feeling it's all downhill from here
5,9dg920_00006,"I'm still laughing at the ""my eyes are circles"" comment. The timing was incredible. I have no idea what he was thinking for that task though."
6,9dg920_00007,"The guessing task seemd a little unbalanced (I’d’ve probably done 3 each way so the max you could score was 6) but that’s the only nit I’ve got to pick with it. Kerry’s off to a roaring start, so far she’s yet to come last once in a task which adds to my overall theory that the way to do well in Taskmaster is to minimise how often you do badly. So far she reminds me a lot of how Watson did except with neuroticism replaced with brashness."
7,9dg920_00008,"I think we got to bear in mind that Alice won 2 episodes (1&9) and she still came last, so it might not go downhill from here. Lets hope so anyway."
8,9dg920_00009,Everyone who enjoyed the episode go give it a 10 on our Imdb webstie:)
9,9dg920_00010,"Who was James talking to in the circle task? Because it really didn't sound like Alex Horne at all, and they never showed him either"
0,9fbez5_00001,"I enjoyed the absolute certainty with which James said, “You can’t hold me upside down.” Only to have Greg reply with equal certainty, “Oh yes I can.”"
1,9fbez5_00002,"""It's your heavy accent"" is my vote for best line of the episode"
2,9fbez5_00003,"""In that case it should have read 'Greg has broken two toilets'."" Next season of Would I Lie To You I'm picking Truth."
3,9fbez5_00004,"Watching these last three episodes, I kind of wonder how close in proximity this series was shot with the last series. They made the right decision to not only make this the 7th series, but to air it almost immediately after the 6th because it's light years better than last series. The actual tasks and the banter in the studio are top-notch: it's probably their best ever so far. It's funny how Kerry's playing just like Lolly did (not a whole deal of critical thinking) but is doing soooo much better, haha!"
4,9fbez5_00005,"Poor Alex, I hope he gets at least one hello from James before the end of the series..."
5,9fbez5_00006,This series is really one of the greats. The episodes are much better than last series’ episodes.
6,9fbez5_00007,Bit worried about Alex's blood pressure 171/100 & 141/90 - I guess filming is stressful.
7,9fbez5_00008,"I'm absolutely in love with Jessica. She's so much fun and has a great gung-ho attitude that's so infectious to watch. It seems like the series is turning in to a proper three-horse-race between Jessica, Kerry and Rhod. With Kerry and Rhod operating on two ends of Direct-Indirect spectrum and Jessica in the middle. Edit: The series so far in a statsy way if you're interested image1, image2"
8,9fbez5_00009,"Friends ended in 2004, that means that complete box set was released in the 2000's."
9,9fbez5_00010,I think Kerry only got third on the best sound task so she wouldn't be the winner in the first three episodes. Her sound was the best and the only one that made Greg laugh when isolated.
10,9fbez5_00011,I love this series more than life itself
11,9fbez5_00012,"This episode is the highest ever rated Taskmaster episode on imdb scoring a 9.5/10, at the moment."
12,9fbez5_00013,Since Rhod didn't correct Alex - Carmarthen is not in the Valleys!!!
13,9fbez5_00014,"Just about to watch - my guess for title-sayer is...hm...Jessica? Maybe Kerri? I'm going with Kerri. (Aside - just watched the newest Travel Man where Jessica guested, and she really does love making that airhorn sound! Like a LOT.) Edit: well that was a pleasant surprise."
14,9fbez5_00015,
15,9fbez5_00016,"I must dispute James' leprosy fact, which earned him an extra point. Squirrels can also have leprosy although there is no mention of this on the Wikipedia page I feel dirty for having corrected the show. But this isn't QI so I suppose we shouldn't expect total factual accuracy."
0,9h8v25_00001,Alex turning the statue as quick as he could and getting caught by James really tickled me. It's not often you see Alex in a hurry
1,9h8v25_00002,"Oh my god that was hilarious, probably the best episode I’ve ever seen. They’re backstabbing each other, trying to outsmart the tasks, getting Greg going, becoming annoyed. It’s the perfect storm."
2,9h8v25_00003,I think that 31.770 trick is the best one of those ever. So much foreshadowing!
3,9h8v25_00004,Phil's haggling joke is back! I've missed it.
4,9h8v25_00005,Oh my... When you thought the episodes couldn’t get better. Such a good series this one. On par with series 1 for competitiveness and for banter with each other. Really shows how stale series 6 was. Also the Love I have towards Rhod Gilbert is unexplainable.
5,9h8v25_00006,"Alex running to turn the statue every time they flicked the switch, is proof that no mater how hard the task, Alex has it worst."
6,9h8v25_00007,"Best EP of this series, lots of actual laugh out loud moments. Jessica is growing on me."
7,9h8v25_00008,"That live task, holy crap! We got a genuine kerfuffle on stage the likes of which we haven't seen since Ranganathan and Key back in S1. Kerry's got a similar lead Liza had but overall the range of scores has proven way more volatile in terms of scores so her lead seems way less secure than Liza's was. Especially since Kerry's scores are tending downwards where Liza's win came mostly from the mid-game. She's still yet to come last in a task though so who knows. Stats for the nerdy kinds like myself:Simple, Intense"
8,9h8v25_00009,Acaster instantly regretting calling Greg a pussy then getting the old arm around the shoulders talk was pretty great. Loved jessica's reaction to that too.
9,9h8v25_00010,"Wait, if it was Alex turning the knight, then Rhod was right: the switch did nothing. It seemed like he wanted to point that out, too."
10,9h8v25_00011,"Did anyone else think there was going to be a secret trick in the lift task. The signs either side of the lift seemed to be saying to take the stairs. ""If nothing is going right go left"" was one of them. I'm probably over thinking this."
11,9h8v25_00012,OLLIE is what his friends call him. We must call him Sir Oliver the Brave.
12,9h8v25_00013,"I'm really curious about the buttons on the scale, I wonder if you can calibrate it so it shows a specific weight while there's nothing on it. That was my first thought when I saw the challenge, I didn't even notice the Ollie connection."
13,9h8v25_00014,"James in the lift was the highlight of the series so far. I would've loved it if someone got the OLLIE clue for the scales. And was that an aeroplane at the end, Rhod? I'm surprised no one questioned it."
14,9h8v25_00015,Only just started the episode but I love Greg going full teacher mode
15,9h8v25_00016,Is the UKTV website not working for anyone else?
0,9j6exe_00001,"I was in the audience! Here's some odds and ends I noticed were cut. During the prize task there was a funny debate out whether or not ""wife"" was a valid relative. I'd put money on that exchange winding up on youtube. Yes, Phil has a tube map in his house. They put Kerry's do-do-do's over footage of Buckingham Palace Guards marching to demonstrate how the music makes anything look stupid. As the results demonstrate, Phil had a major disadvantage in the circles task. I've done the Maths and Phil had to be over twice as good as the average of the other contestants to even have a chance of winning. (This wasn't acknowledged in the episode but I want that to be known). There was a long exchange about Phil's technique. He actually put Yogurt in the mayonnaise bottle and was using that for the final round of circles. Jeff is the producer's Father-In-Law. This came to light after James declared a burning hatred for him. Okay, so the Languishing bit... Alex said he wanted to say ""Wanguishing"" instead of ""Languishing"" but was worried about it coming across wrong. After a few attempts Phil said he'd interrupt and act like he said it. This went back and forth for about 15 minutes and it ended with Phil getting one of those comedically-exaggerated applause from the audience where he got to hold the taskmaster trophy. The episode was slightly reordered. Not hugely: The intro to the final prerecorded task was filmed before the final ad break. So it originally went Intro -> Ads -> Attempts. Not Ads -> Intro -> Attempts. James slowly explaining how they did the perspective task went on for like 4 times as long and was incredibly unfunny. Interesting to see a joke flop that got completely snipped out. Jess and Kerry said their perspective film was originally much longer but got cut from even the studio seeing it. That task in general languished a bit in the studio. It took Kerry a looooooong time to understand the rules of the live task. Explaining the rules took longer than the task actually went on for. A few things to note. Greg stood up and made a formal apology to the production team for how badly it went, Phil was right predicting that most of the items were weighted wrongly (one of the Teddy Bears made an almighty thunk when it was placed on the stage), and apparently the production team got 18 items hanging on it in their practice run. The stuff that went on under the credits was super reedited as well. Jess didn't drop the statuette until well after the music had finished and only after the audience started chanting ""drop it, drop it, drop it"". Also. The way the show works is they film it all in one go, then after the 5 contestants leave Greg and Alex re-do the ad bumpers and some other bits so the editors have options. This episode was the first ever time the producers didn’t ask Greg to rerecord the introduction. So he’s improving."
1,9j6exe_00002,"Just finished watching, another good ep (and great to see Kerry's solo lead being disrupted) Incidentally, Sian (Rhod's wife) took to twitter to show off that ridiculous gift from Greg when she received it for her birthday. It is no less weird close up: https://twitter.com/sianharries_/status/1006231309176451074"
2,9j6exe_00003,"I've been a fan of Kerry Godliman's work for ages (If you can get to hear ""Start/Stop"" give it a listen), and she's being ace on TaskMaster. I didn't know anything at all about Jessica Knappett before TaskMaster. She's brilliant! I love that she has repeatedly not read the card properly. Last week, at the mention of ""brillo pad tits"", James leapt from his chair and ran in a circle around it. His face when Jessica said _her quote_ was amazing. I love that they're all in the studio together and that they clearly enjoy each other's work. Greg appeared genuinely to be shocked-laughing at that quote. tl;dr I love this programme and everyone on it and everything about it. Even S06."
3,9j6exe_00004,anyone else feel bad for phil wang and want him to have at least one miraculous victory?
4,9j6exe_00005,Just finished the episode. Correct in saying that it wasnt as good as last time. But some great moments including Rhod’s Javelin throw. That task I particularly liked. Also the Traffic warden task I found great. Funniest bit of the whole show was Rhods attempt at that task. Only 8 points separating him and Kerry now... C’MON RHODRI!!!!!!
5,9j6exe_00006,"At around 15 minutes when they were discussing the fireworks, Alex mentions that James' part was filmed on November 2nd? Was this just a joke line or was it actually filmed 10 months ago, because I didn't think they usually filmed so far in advance."
6,9j6exe_00007,Tell me if its a good one so I can start watching tonight!
7,9j6exe_00008,"I really hope Jessica's comment in the Prize Task becomes a GIF on the Dave Twitter. After reading about how they structure the episodes, I'm actually surprised we didn't leave the house this episode. That, combined with the weaker team tasks, probably disrupted the momenum from the last four episodes and made it feel exceptionally weak. The banter is still really good (although nothing beat's Kerry's angry face from Episode 4 when she said she 'was running'), so it saves it from wallowing into boring TV."
0,9l5qdz_00001,Someone should have bought in Tim Key...
1,9l5qdz_00002,I think that was the best studio task of the whole of taskmaster.
2,9l5qdz_00003,James not saying hello to Alex at the start of every task is still my favourite thing this series.
3,9l5qdz_00004,Cul-de-sac genuinely made me tear up from laughing. How did they not win that one?
4,9l5qdz_00005,Love this episode. Consistently laughed through out. Probably actually one of my favourite recent episodes! Shame we didnt get to see Alex finish the pie though.
5,9l5qdz_00006,"I was sure that Cul-de-Sac, the most gripping high budget soap drama of our generation would win. This is like getting snubbed at the Emmys."
6,9l5qdz_00007,Alternate title for Kerry and Jess’ soap-opera: Prima Donnas
7,9l5qdz_00008,Was Kerry and Jessica called Donna? I'm sad Phil didn't haggle for his G.
8,9l5qdz_00009,"I feel like in the last few episodes there's been a lot of unfair loses for Phil and a lot of unfair wins for James. Stuff like the portrait in this episode were one of the times I legit just have no idea what Greg was doing with the scores. if you look at the series so far Phil has scored roughly the same as Nish did, which feels so not-the-case. While this has been by far the funniest series so far I think this is the one so far that felt least fair as a game."
9,9l5qdz_00010,Okay so this one is my 2nd fave of the whole series (2nd to OLLIE). But... it has the funniest task of the whole series so far in it. Not necessarily the cleverest and Taskmasterest but cry/belly/dying laughing. Rubadubdub... shouldve been episode name.
10,9l5qdz_00011,
11,9l5qdz_00012,"Phil's outrage at the ""leafy duck"" had me genuinely cackle so loud that I scared my cat."
12,9l5qdz_00013,They should put the full games of tag up on youtube.
13,9l5qdz_00014,Am I the only one suprised that no one thought of sticking the bin over their heads and locking themselves in the shed before Alex could touch their shoulder?
14,9l5qdz_00015,James' portrait was superb. Possibly my favourite art-piece in the whole of Taskmaster.
15,9l5qdz_00016,
16,9l5qdz_00017,"Ironically, I think the ones who didn’t put a variety of items in their bins did the best because they actually had to be creative in how they used their items (e.g. James’ ukulele and Rhod’s leaves). Poor Phil actually screwed himself over with that many items, but he probably should have done more than Lord Davies’ face, haha. I’m glad we got to see both of Kerry’s tasks that she mentioned in her promotion interview! Definitely can see why she enjoyed the soap opera one."
17,9l5qdz_00018,Phil didn’t say the correct phrase to end part one of the bin task...
0,9n36ef_00001,"I don't think I blinked watching that blinking task. Rhod's performance was absolutely insane on a level we've never seen before. I think this has to be the best episode of the Series so far, candidate for best in the show's run. Not a moment didn't absolutely hit it out of the part. And every thing about taskmaster that's brilliant came up. Cooperation and conflict, insanity and inanity, and contestants nearly getting really hurt. Since the series scores were said this episode I figured I'd drop the overall contestant performance chart."
1,9n36ef_00002,"This is up there with OLLIE as one of the best this series, and I am beyond excited that Phil's haggling joke is back, highlight of the series for me."
2,9n36ef_00003,I just love watching James get angry. Always a highlight for me.
3,9n36ef_00004,James' rant finally secured this series as my favorite of the whole show! This cast is absolutely amazing.
4,9n36ef_00005,It's another cracking episode. Poor Jessica though :)
5,9n36ef_00006,Alex Tweeted saying this episode was his favourite of series 7. High Hopes?
6,9n36ef_00007,"Genuine question, those size ear gauges wouldn't heal shut after you took them out would they? You'd be left with a decent sized hole wouldn't you? Surely it was faked somehow?"
7,9n36ef_00008,"Holy moly, those are two straight iconic live tasks. I genuinely started cry-laughing from how ridiculous this one was. Jess is doing surprisingly well for someone who didn't seem to quite think things through sometimes."
8,9n36ef_00009,Genuinely can't stop laughing at Jess' fall. Highlight of the series for me!
9,9n36ef_00010,I've been waiting for the moment of genuine anger and it doesn't disappoint.
10,9n36ef_00011,"Still finding it very hard to beat OLLIE as an episode but this is definitely on par. No denyinh any more that this has been the best series of Taskmaster after series 5. The competion is well and truly getting exciting now! Cmon Rhodri, do it for us back in Wales!!!"
11,9n36ef_00012,"I'll be honest, I was expecting Alex to pull of fake ears and reveal he hadn't pierced his ears. I am in disbelief right now because of that."
12,9n36ef_00013,Best live task ever
13,9n36ef_00014,"Never thought Alex would look good with tunnels, and that they would suit him, but um??? Wow??? James' absolute anger is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on this show. Definitely a highlight that will go down in TM history. I watched it 7 or 8 times before linking it to my friends who don't watch British comedy shows. Poor Jess, though. I had to pause the episode and, out loud, say, ""Oh noooooooo""."
14,9n36ef_00015,"I’m surprised no one for the blinking task just didn’t have a sleep. This was my first reaction, keep them closed."
15,9n36ef_00016,"I'm so glad that this series is back to its best. I was worried after series 6 that it was getting stale or I was getting bored of it. Not that it was bad, it was just the least good. The banter wasn't there as it was before. There was a certain spark missing. Cant wait to find out who will be in series 8!"
16,9n36ef_00017,I don't know what it says about my personality that my first thought on the bin task was to get an axe and obliterate the fence.
17,9n36ef_00018,anyone else finding LAH attractive for the first time? i didn't think i liked gauges so much but i'm having some very confusing feelings over here.
18,9n36ef_00019,"Is it bad that on the blink task my inner whovian came out and my plan was to do as Anemia Pond did and just wink with alternate eyes... Until I realised the keep your eyes closed gag, then I'd have just had a nap !"
19,9n36ef_00020,"Based on his performance in the extension task, I suspect one of the later episodes in the series will see Rhod being given a secret task to sabotage one of the team tasks."
0,9p2qk8_00001,"I was at the recording of this one so I will try and share some details! Just to make things clear, I'm not one hundred percent what has made it into the episode yet as UKTVPlay seems to be struggling. I am making educated guesses on what didn't quite make it to air. Rhod made a slightly politically incorrect joke in regards to the drawing that Phil brought in which all the cast joked about how the editors would definitely be snipping that one out. Kerry was incredibly proud of her song that she had performed and initially Greg had dismissed it as quite shit but after quite a long conversation I think she persuaded him to reconsider. I then heard them talking on one of the little two minute breaks and she managed to convince him to be a bit nicer about the song and during the pickups at the end he was more positive about it. I also heard Greg and Alex talking after the live task about how they had many more prepared just in case people didn't go out very quickly. I also think that the task went on for longer than made it to air as there was quite a few rounds especially towards the beginning where everyone was consistently getting them right. They were talking about how they would cut it down in post. After the guests were sent away after the show Greg and Alex had to complete the pickups for mistakes earlier in the show and the gallery told them simultaneously how many things they had to reshoot. At the same time Alex remarked ""That's not so bad!"" and Greg said ""Fucking hell"". I think they had to reshoot about 11(?) things in the end. This one I have left near the bottom because this is most likely to have made it in but like I said earlier I can't actually check if that is true or not. Alex very nearly plunged into the audience because Greg had let go of Alex's harness. I'll also just talk about the filming process in general just if anyone is curious! There was a warmup guy who was incredibly funny who was letting us in on little anecdotes about the show and talking to the audience about where they had traveled from, who's hometown was the shittest and if any types of round food were tasty. He gave out some of Greg's cuecards after the show to some of the audience members who had participated in his questioning. The filming of the earlier show was delayed a little and it took about 3 hours for ours all told. There was a nice tent they kept us in and gave us free beers whilst we waited! They did mention about how there had been paramedics after Jessica's fall in the previous episode, which was funny to finally get context for last week. I'll add anything if I remember, and please feel free to ask questions! :)"
1,9p2qk8_00002,Rod in Greg's wardrobe has been my favourite part of this season
2,9p2qk8_00003,This Grotto task makes me question Rhod's sanity.
3,9p2qk8_00004,"I always found James weirdly attractive, but the music task made him even more weirdly attractive. Haha. I was also secretly hoping we’d get a reprise of Kerry’s spectacular delivery tune. I also have to admit I’m with Kerry: the violinist/fiddler is also attractive."
4,9p2qk8_00005,"Another banger of an episode, the music task is one of my favourites!"
5,9p2qk8_00006,"I think this may be my favourite episode ever, and Rhod's song was incredible"
6,9p2qk8_00007,"I hope James is enjoying the experience because he clearly does love the show, and I really want him to love being on it even though he's not very good and being harshly scored sometimes. Also, Jessica is god-tier contestant. ""sesame street""."
7,9p2qk8_00008,"Ok well I mean, cry laughing at Rhods grotto task. And urm ye I think I’m in love with Rhod Gilbert. Nothing major but I want him as my 2nd uncle."
8,9p2qk8_00009,I feel Rhod getting that many points for the music task when he went triple the allowed time is kinda bullshit? Like.. I feel it would have been fair to disqualify him or to just put him near the bottom but tied for second? Rhod seems to get away with a lot
0,9r4cdg_00001,"James losing it over the satsuma task really made me laugh, a LOT."
1,9r4cdg_00002,(a) I’m sad we have to wait two weeks. (b) I’m sad this series is almost over because this has genuinely been one of the best casts. (c) A LIME!
2,9r4cdg_00003,"It would appear that after that episode, Rhod is sadly out of the series running - this is firmly a Kerry-Jess race now. Which means, and I didn't think I was going to say this as she was my least favourite going in, I'm now rooting for Jess."
3,9r4cdg_00004,"Without doubt the funniest episode of the series (SEASON) for me! I haven’t been entirely sold on this series but it’s been getting better each episode. James’ increasingly angry rants have me in stitches. Love Jessica and want her to win the series now. Edit: also wanted to add, I love the tasks where there is a hidden message or trick, like the big ‘8’ in the satsuma task. Or in previous episodes the Morse-coded balloons, briefcase code above the door, or the stationery/useful objects being under the table."
4,9r4cdg_00005,A LIME
5,9r4cdg_00006,James freaking out was fucking hilarious!
6,9r4cdg_00007,Not the best episode but the bar was so high ghat’s not saying much. Feels a bit like they took the chance to put some of the weaker tasks together to raise the quality of the other episodes. Plus the double-task where they split the 5 up wasn’t a great idea but I respect the attempt
7,9r4cdg_00008,https://task.wikia.com/wiki/Series_7 This episode was a nightmare to add.
8,9r4cdg_00009,"Anyone notice what Rhod said when he went into the house on the satsuma task? ""I was going for the scissors but as luck would have it I found a tangerine in the kitchen"". He should have lost that task for not having the right type of easy peeler. (I'm sure it probably was a satsuma, but it would have been funny if they'd had an action replay of him claiming it was a tangerine and then having to investigate whether he'd won)"
9,9r4cdg_00010,"Personally for me, one of the weaker episodes but again no Taskmaster episode is bad comedy. Some bits better than the other, but as per the banter between the gang this year really is top notch."
10,9r4cdg_00011,"""Do you have confidence for the rest of us?"""
11,9r4cdg_00012,"The photo of Greg's mother in the bath, and Greg not turning around to even notice it at first, was probably my favourite part of the show so far!"
12,9r4cdg_00013,"Did anyone else think with the Socks & Stasuma task, at the start that the ‘8’ on the shed might be sort of prep or left over from the caravan reveal for the 8th series... or was that just me?"
13,9r4cdg_00014,
14,9r4cdg_00015,Me neither.
15,9r4cdg_00016,Really loved this episode and was iffy on the season but I’m turning out to really enjoy it. I’m an American and i dont know is that is a factor or if Americans also know and I’m super ignorant but I have no idea what a satsuma is lol. I have looked it up now but I would have absolutely no idea haha
16,9r4cdg_00017,When is the next episode?
0,9v041g_00001,The video game task is one of the best ones I think they've ever done. James' GTA absolutely killed me
1,9v041g_00002,I am not ready for this one to end. Its been a good series with this gang. The best cast and series yet.
2,9v041g_00003,What are the odds of Kerry and Greg saying laminator at the same time!?
3,9v041g_00004,"Someone had a fantastic day in RPGmaker in the opening of the gaming task. That alone had me brimming with joy the whole time. Edit: Now it's done. The spreadsheet of numbers has been updated In English some observations. This is a really low scoring series. The winner ends with 176/287 points which is a really low proportion in relation to previous winners. Heck, Al Murray ended with a higher percentage than that and he came third. Phil Wang is the 2nd worst performing contestant in the show's history with 133/287. If he'd won 3 less points he'd've been dead last. Despite winning 3 episodes and tying a 4th. All of James' wins were really low wins, which explains why it feels like his ending score was lower than expected."
4,9v041g_00005,Like fuck Rhod did all that in an hour
5,9v041g_00006,"I saw this episode recorded live. Sausage or finger literally went on for about 30 minutes, they had to cut out so much ahaha"
6,9v041g_00007,"Hilarious that James never greeting Alex turned out not to be a task at all, a facet of his own personality was so odd that I completely assumed it was a secret task"
7,9v041g_00008,"Great continuity from Dave ""We remind viewers that this show contains strong language... probably from the losers."""
8,9v041g_00009,Tie yourself up is going to be where the boiler suits come in isnt it?
9,9v041g_00010,I SUGGESTED TYING UP ALEX. I FEEL SO JUSTIFIED!
10,9v041g_00011,This game task could be my favourite task ever. What a great idea!
11,9v041g_00012,"SAUSAGE OR FINGER is the craze sweeping the nation. Fortnite is no longer the leading streamed game on Twitch, it's Sausage or Finger."
12,9v041g_00013,"BOSCH! Great series, glad kerry won."
13,9v041g_00014,This video game task is FANTASTIC.
14,9v041g_00015,I started binging this show only a couple of weeks ago and I was all caught up by Monday so I'm crazy excited for the finale. The worst part is that I'm in India so at least 12 hours to go here :(
15,9v041g_00016,"*Spoiler Severely dissapointed that Greg won't have to tolerate Rhod for another ten episodes, I would really have loved to have seen that (and I suspect that as his second go round, he would have abbandoned trolling Greg with every prize task and just focused on the task, perhaps just annoying Greg now and again). I'd like to seen how he'd have faired against other winners."
16,9v041g_00017,"If they had a 5/4/3/2/1 system for the final challenge like they usually do, Jess would have won. I get the feeling that was done on purpose and maybe part of what Phil said that it was rigged in a way. Can't help but be disappointed that the wrong person won."
17,9v041g_00018,"Good episode to finish overall. Amazing that it was so close. The video game task was pretty cool and I loved the boiler suit/tie-up task, classic Taskmaster. Rhod is a genius. Last task was a bit ropey tbh. It’s unfair for the person who happens to go first to get eliminated straight away. A points-based system would have been better where they played maybe 3 rounds."
18,9v041g_00019,"Hoping Rhod can have a comeback final week, obviously requires a lot of luck from Kerry and Jess doing badly but who knows. I wouldn't mind if Jess won, but Kerry is too much like Liza to make the champion of champions series any good and Jess/Rhod would bring the better energy. Easily the best series so far though imo, the run from episode 4 to 8 was the highlight. Should be a good finale going by the title too."
19,9v041g_00020,Team Jess! Come on!
20,9v041g_00021,"Best series overall. The wrong winner, but she has be favored all series, so it was easy to see coming. Furthermore, the last task was scored rather unfairly, but such is the game."
21,9v041g_00022,How did Kerry have 7 points after the egg task? Did I miss something?
22,9v041g_00023,What time is it possible that someone could upload the episode here?
23,9v041g_00024,Excited about Season 8? Talk about it on this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/taskmaster/comments/9v3dt1/season_8_preair_discussion_thread/
24,9v041g_00025,No teaser? :(
25,9v041g_00026,The video game task just makes me all the more keen for a Taskmaster YouTuber special than I was already (there are some very talented ones who would be very entertaining even if they aren't traditional comedians).
26,9v041g_00027,This is why I don't want Kerry to win the series.
27,9v041g_00028,Can someone please let me know S8 cast once it’s announced please. I’m off to work and won’t get to find out till late tonight and I can’t take that amount of suspense all day :-) thanks in advance
28,9v041g_00029,James is on the comeback tonight! Can he still do it?
29,9v041g_00030,what a good series! can't wait for the next one!
30,9v041g_00031,"""I can hear it gooping"" is my favourite episode title yet. I want to sing it to the tune of In The Air Tonight. ""I can hear it gooping in the egg tonight... oh yeah"""
31,9v041g_00032,"Great series, but I feel like I missed something.... was there no singled out person task????"
32,9v041g_00033,I was sure they were going to reveal that James had been assigned a special task to never say hello to Alex.
33,9v041g_00034,

23,czltl1_00024,Baddiel with my first big laugh of the series. I reckon he'll be my favourite
24,czltl1_00025,I love Taskmaster and this series is no exception. It’s brilliant as ever! I went to two recordings (this being one of them) and my only issue is how much they have to edit out... there was a lot more banter about ROYGBIV and the dodo! I know they have to cut bits out though. Still easily the best programme on telly :)
25,czltl1_00026,"David ""Poo Roll"" Baddiel"

29,czltl1_00030,Bloody Brilliant. Back to its best. Ed and Katie’s entrances had me in stitches. All 5 are brilliant. Such a great first episode.
30,czltl1_00031,"This seems like it'll be a great series. I like all five of them so far. I hadn't seen anything of Rose, Katie or Ed before this, but they're all really funny, especially Rose. They've all got good task- solving minds too, even David... sometimes. Seems like the prize task offerings have gone up a notch from last series, thank god."

32,czltl1_00033,Do people in the UK really not know Roy G Biv for the rainbow?
33,czltl1_00034,They're gonna be finding bits of Rose's for weeks
34,czltl1_00035,"Ah, standard rules, of course."
35,czltl1_00036,Are Greg and Alex wearing the same socks?
36,czltl1_00037,Is it just me or do the chairs look new?
37,czltl1_00038,"THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH OUR ROYGBIV, GREG."
38,czltl1_00039,"Honestly in the last series, i thought maybe this show had jumped the shark and maybe i` d seen it all before and had grown tired of it, but in retrospect i think its the contestants which make the show and boy do we seem to have a great bunch this time ! Dont know the young lad but love his attitude to the show so far ! Jo and David I think are going to be great and love the 2 girls who I also didnt know before tonight. Cant wait for next week !"
39,czltl1_00040,
40,czltl1_00041,"The Greg portrait is based on Arcimboldo's Vertumnus and this series not only is the house themed along with the portrait, but Greg's studio throne is also fruit and veg themed! (Alex's chair has changed too, but it's vaguely Egyptian, I think?)"
41,czltl1_00042,If this is any indication for the whole series we’re in for a good one!
42,czltl1_00043,"Absolutely loved the first episode and all contestants! If this continues, definitely in the run for my favourite series. Quick come backs and interesting tasks so far! I also think that the scoring was mainly fair even though an empty toilet roll would be my 5 score! So many favourites parts -the contestants putting actual effort in the prize task, “in the world” and checking for Braille, the tables being turned on Alex finding the aubergines, David going for the silliest hiding places but having the guts to eat some, Ed’s dramatic entrance, the odd amount of baby heads, Stella and Join our cult!"
43,czltl1_00044,Who's your favourite contestant? Don't forget you can add a user flair with any contestant from the past 9 seasons!
44,czltl1_00045,That's not an aubergine
45,czltl1_00046,Hahahaha baddiel and the aubergine. This season looking great so far
46,czltl1_00047,The simplest tasks are often the funniest. Loved David’s approach
47,czltl1_00048,Taste the fucking lollies Edit: thank god for common sense prevailing
48,czltl1_00049,Feels kinda blue to me too
49,czltl1_00050,Still can't get over that atrocious cow floor lol
50,czltl1_00051,02075987323.
51,czltl1_00052,
52,czltl1_00053,"No one has mentioned the meerkat eyes Ed ended up with after the goggles were removed, which then transferred into him having a black hand when he rubbed it off!! That was so hilarious to me. I was sad none of the others got to take them off, so I am still not sure if it was intentional, or just a gag played on Ed?"
53,czltl1_00054,How incompetent was Ed. He could see and did the same as rose
54,czltl1_00055,"This is gonna be a great series I can feel it, all of them seemed to be hilarious and on point. My personal favourites seem to be wix, gamble and baddiel"
55,czltl1_00056,If this episode is any indication we could be l9oking at the best series of taskmaster (series 4 us still my current favourite)
56,czltl1_00057,Ed Gamble absolutely nailed the recreation of a Sunn O))) live performance
57,czltl1_00058,Katy's dramatic entrance was so godman weird and unexpected it had me in stitches. Excited for this season!
58,czltl1_00059,A bit gutted Peter Andre's name was mentioned and we didn't get to hear Greg's impression of him. If you haven't heard it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZdD-vvOCR4
59,czltl1_00060,Oh man how can you eat one. They taste so bad lol
60,czltl1_00061,Shaping up to be a very promising season so far. Long may it continue!
61,czltl1_00062,Dang he was so close to being amazing. Amateur hour on the fly.
62,czltl1_00063,Well that's the rainbow mnemonic changed forever in my head.
63,czltl1_00064,"Great opener to the series, already some great moments from all 5 contestants, really looking forward to the future of the series and how the chemistry develops across the series!"
64,czltl1_00065,Rose's dramatic entrance legit scared me. So good.
65,czltl1_00066,"Gentlemen, the time has come"
66,czltl1_00067,Very strong opening episode and a great bunch of contestants (Brand and Baddiel are dream castings for me) I can see that David us the Sinha this series and as a whovian I would have given his entrance 5 points.
67,czltl1_00068,"Once again a series in which I know only one contestant well. Unless you count Rose Matafeo's recent Cats. But Jo Brand and her cynicism have been great comforts to me in my age (also Liza Tarbuck and Kathy Burke) -- I guess I miss my mum. I'm passing familiar with David Baddiel and Ed Gamble, Katy Wix is an utterly unknown quantity for me. Last utterly unknown quantities include Paul Chowdhry and Mark Watson, and I was well pleased to meet both of them just as I am Katy. I think she's got this weird Mortimerian vibration, something a bit boxless. As far as 9.01 goes, I'm wetting myself. Genuine disrespect mixed with blatantly honest effort in the magic-laced Aubergine Task, dark memories violently ripped from my reptile brain by Poo Roll ""In the World?"" Baddiel, and the bizarre blind spot for fireworks and amplified music shared by each hopeful... It's gorgeous and looking to get better."
68,czltl1_00069,"Usually, it takes me at least 2-3 episodes to fully fall in love with the contestants but I'm immediately into these lot. Super excited for what's to come!"
69,czltl1_00070,I love ads
70,czltl1_00071,David must've eaten one
71,czltl1_00072,My dad also calls my penis a dodo
72,czltl1_00073,I’m loving this
73,czltl1_00074,David better win
74,czltl1_00075,What was the phone number? I'd like to ring it and see if it's a voicemail from Alex or something
75,czltl1_00076,Well done Rose
76,czltl1_00077,What's the artistic theme for this season? I can't tell by the painting in the main room.
77,czltl1_00078,Ed's cat camo jacket is superb.
78,czltl1_00079,I find it interesting Greg didn't comment on Baddiel chucking the ice lolly at Alex. Also Katy Wix was Fergie on the Windsors and it's so weird to see her out of role and speaking normally!
79,czltl1_00080,"The dynamic of this episode feels so much better than the last couple of series. I think it's going to be a good one! Some very funny moments in last night's episode! I thought that I was going to really dislike Katy and Ed, but so far they've been very entertaining. I particularly like Rose so far."
80,czltl1_00081,For those who didn’t know Ed Gamble is Type 1 Diabetic hence why Alex made that blood sugar joke.
81,czltl1_00082,"Huzzah! After one episode, I don’t hate any of the contestants! The tasks were top notch Taskmaster, and the performances were equally in keeping with the show’s high standards, even in the studio. My only tiniest complaint is that there were no lab or caravan tasks. Still, I’m optimistic for a great Series 9!"
82,czltl1_00083,
83,czltl1_00084,Eyy. More ads
84,czltl1_00085,"Already disagreeing massively with Greg’s subjective ranking, can’t wait for the post-episode survey"
85,czltl1_00086,Who's phone number was that?
86,czltl1_00087,
87,czltl1_00088,
88,czltl1_00089,"Trying to remember from filming what got cut. Fairly certain there was more jokes around the loo roll and aubergine, as I remember the banter being much bluer than I was expecting given the male/female ratio of the contestants. David argued a bit about Rose or Jo's lolly score, and there was more talk about Katy's cult. Will see if I can remember anything else"
89,czltl1_00090,👉🏻🍆
90,czltl1_00091,"If I were a Taskmaster contestant this season, I would've certainly taken Rose to task over her pronunciation of the word ""second"" and, in relation to that task, enquire as to which 'sick end' of the snake are we supposed to draw, the one that eats Indonesian grandmothers or the one that shits them back out?"
91,czltl1_00092,
92,czltl1_00093,Since when do adults need a mnemonic (Richard of York gave battle in vein) to remember the colours of the rainbow? I genuinely thought everyone just knew that!

95,czltl1_00096,
0,d2d0v6_00001,Im so glad Jo and David were teamed. That whole task is some if the best taskmaster ive ever seen.
1,d2d0v6_00002,"Another favourite moment from the episode: David on Ed's portrait: Did you get a primary school kid to do the background? Ed: ""David, why the f*ck are you talking ?'"
2,d2d0v6_00003,The way no delivered the line “I did know we were doing it against the clock and I didn’t give a fuck” was so joyous
3,d2d0v6_00004,Loved David calling out the editors for using ‘slow old people music’ during his and Jo’s task.
4,d2d0v6_00005,The demeaning task was definitely one of the best tasks in the history of the show. Was laughing throughout.
5,d2d0v6_00006,"I went to the recording of this episode! If anyone's interested, I'll try to remember what they've cut out after watching this"
6,d2d0v6_00007,This task with David and Jo is fucking amazing lol
7,d2d0v6_00008,The Choose Your Own Taskventure task is one of my favourite tasks of all time!
8,d2d0v6_00009,Jo and David are giving Mel and Hugh a run for their money as my favourite team. I was crying with laughter during the team task. That was an absolutely brilliant episode. Really love this line up.
9,d2d0v6_00010,So disappointed that no one pushed Alex's bin over
10,d2d0v6_00011,Quite possibly the best episode ever.
11,d2d0v6_00012,"""As always it's a team of three and a team of two, and that is definitely fair, and no one ever gets in touch to say it isn't shakes head"" *looks around this place 😂😅"
12,d2d0v6_00013,I think it's unfair that one team has three people and the other team has two
13,d2d0v6_00014,Such a tender moment when Ed carried little Alex Horne out of the wheely bin
14,d2d0v6_00015,"I think this is my favourite line up and David and Jo will be the best team. Dying from the team task, softened the butter hah"
15,d2d0v6_00016,I think Jo and David in that team task is one of the funniest things to happen on the show ever
16,d2d0v6_00017,This is my absolute favourite line up to date. I love them all.
17,d2d0v6_00018,"I love that Katy and Rose are making an effort at the prize task. I'm really enjoying Jo (and I was worried that I wouldn't). I knew Katy would be brilliant, and I think she is. I didn't know anything about Rose but she's also brilliant."
18,d2d0v6_00019,"G: It’s breathtaking arrogance. K: I know, welcome to my world. 😆👌🏻"
19,d2d0v6_00020,Rose jumping in glee when she saw the others in the team task was so god damn endearing
20,d2d0v6_00021,"Possibly one of the best episodes of not only Taskmaster, but all television of all time. It was pure anarchic joy tonight! With the right combination of people, given the right tasks the show creates pure comedic anarchy, that's why I love Taskmaster so much."
21,d2d0v6_00022,This is incredible. It's about the closest I've seen to Greg and Alex losing control and they've got no clue! Two of the oldest contestants and it's like trying to herd five year olds. I love it!
22,d2d0v6_00023,Alex eating the sweets reminds me of the time my sister ate one of the Toxic Waste sweets and cried.
23,d2d0v6_00024,Everybody seems to be having tremendous fun and it's all rather sweet. A total change in energy from the overly-competitive Series 8 and the just brutal Series 7.
24,d2d0v6_00025,"This could become my favourite series, or at least up there with a couple of others. They're all funny, all look at tasks from fun/intelligent/hilariously bad angles, and they bounce off each other well. Great stuff."
25,d2d0v6_00026,"For the live task, would combining all the balls, throwing the combined ball into the bucket and then flattening it win the task? After all, for example, the rules say to flatten the yellow balls, not to flatten only the yellow balls."
26,d2d0v6_00027,What a lovely bunch this cast is. It's shaping up to be a feel good series like S5. I greatly approve.
27,d2d0v6_00028,This cheese string advert can fuck right off.
28,d2d0v6_00029,"""Butter In The Microwave"", not ""The Gobblers"
29,d2d0v6_00030,Is Ed's a picture of Ed?
30,d2d0v6_00031,When Jo and David started making tea I was crying with laughter.
31,d2d0v6_00032,I’d have called this episode ‘Guantanamo Bay’
32,d2d0v6_00033,Alex’s “banter” is as great as ever.
33,d2d0v6_00034,I love this cast already. I laughed myself to tears during that team task
34,d2d0v6_00035,David asked for paint and an apron even though a) he only drew red lips b) there already was a red marker c) he might just have used said red marker to draw said red lips??? Classic Taskmaster panic. Love it.
35,d2d0v6_00036,"Did anybody else catch the weird editing in the final task, where Jo picked up the red balls and put them into the bucket twice? I thought I was being crazy at first, but my fiance pointed it out as well - strange from a show with usually great editing"
36,d2d0v6_00037,This cheese strings advert pisses me off to no end and I'm not sure why
37,d2d0v6_00038,"I mean one of the best episodes of Taskmaster, that. Proper Entertainment."
38,d2d0v6_00039,"Jo and David have become my favourite TM team already, that entire team task was brilliant"
39,d2d0v6_00040,This is already my favourite series for years. The contestants are a great mix and the tasks have been great. One thing I don’t get about the adventure task though - how did the children keep going in circles? They read both tasks from the toaster but it was only the 3rd or 4th time the task said to go to the lab. Was someone from the production team changing the tasks along the way? And why didn’t that happen to the gobblers?
40,d2d0v6_00041,I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard at an episode of this show than I did tonight. My favourite one by a mile.
41,d2d0v6_00042,SPOILER: David Baddiel will be having a sandwich!
42,d2d0v6_00043,I JUST LOVE THESE PEOPLE
43,d2d0v6_00044,"My idea for the drawing task was to just draw Greg entirely in one A1 sheet, just like Jo did."
44,d2d0v6_00045,The prize tasks are turning out to be some of the best ever. I expect it will be like this right through the series!
45,d2d0v6_00046,"""ED, YELLOW"""
46,d2d0v6_00047,Quite possibly one of the best episodes of Taskmaster. I was in stitches. A really great line up and great tasks.
47,d2d0v6_00048,Taskmaster makes me laugh out loud more than anything on tv right now.
48,d2d0v6_00049,"Can someone explain this to me? In the last task, David put all the balls on top of the bucket and gave it to Alex like a hat and said ""Ambassador..."" something something. My ignorant ass did not get that. Or is that a British thing? IDK. 🤔🤔🤔"
49,d2d0v6_00050,This might be one of the few series where I genuinely love each and every one of the contestants
50,d2d0v6_00051,No way did Katy deserve 5 there
51,d2d0v6_00052,
52,d2d0v6_00053,Glad to finally have confirmation of what this episode is bloody called.
53,d2d0v6_00054,Watching on Dave ja vu... I am absolutely loving this series so far. I was crying laughing during David and Jo’s task.
54,d2d0v6_00055,any links yet?
55,d2d0v6_00056,"as far as overall episodes, this might have been my favorite of the whole show so far. every task was great imo"
56,d2d0v6_00057,I guess this means in 10-15 years Joe Wilkinson can be on the Baddiel/Brand team to enjoy their sandwiches and eggs in peace. Haha.
57,d2d0v6_00058,I love sour sweets
58,d2d0v6_00059,"For the portrait task , i would have numbered each page and then ripped it out and organised it myself into the right order. Then you can just draw once it’s all in the right place"
59,d2d0v6_00060,Genuinely my favourite live task so far.
60,d2d0v6_00061,"Ed had the most clever idea for the drawing task. We had to do a similar thing when drawing large sketches of invertebrates in my zoology classes, you looked at them under a microscope on top of a grid, then just drew bigger versions on graph paper. I can't draw at all, but I was really pleased with how mine turned out because you just use the segments and measure within each grid. Obviously the upside down sections made it harder."
61,d2d0v6_00062,
62,d2d0v6_00063,
63,d2d0v6_00064,"I haven't quite got into the last couple of seasons, especially the last one which felt like it was missing something. This one however is looking like it could be my favourite one yet. This episode (and particularly the group task) was fantastic."
64,d2d0v6_00065,
0,d5uuqo_00001,"If I'd known in advance, I wouldn't have made a baby 🤣 Ed's quickly becoming my fav"
1,d5uuqo_00002,"The live task was brilliant! I was kind of hoping they would say what was in all the vials at the end. I loved Katie's deadpan ""I'm broken, but I don't think I can fix me in 7 minutes"" line... and Ed realizing he fucked up with the chocolate. What I love about Taskmaster is how one mistake (like choosing wrong object to break) can really screw you over, as you have to deal with its ridiculous consequences. Really love this cast though - there's an effortless humor & chemistry with them, which makes it fun to watch."
2,d5uuqo_00003,'Stick or the dick?' - This show out of context is very weird
3,d5uuqo_00004,"I was at this recording, and Greg getting right up close to Alex’s face was quite intense"
4,d5uuqo_00005,"To anyone disappointed by this episode: How can you be disappointed at getting to see David Baddiel weakly hit a broadcast award with a sledgehammer, then attempt to light it on fire?"
5,d5uuqo_00006,"Was there anything in the task that said they had to be on the steam roller? I guess most of them probably wanted to ride it, but my immediate instinct would have been to just kick it in."
6,d5uuqo_00007,I'm so glad a giant wooden penis was brought by one of them lol
7,d5uuqo_00008,"So... Was the board purple? It looked blue to me but I'm colourblind, so purple makes the most sense"
8,d5uuqo_00009,"I love this cast. Rose is amazing. I liked the tasks. I think having two ""do this thing. Oho! There's another task"" in one episode doesn't work so well. But this series is really lovely."
9,d5uuqo_00010,didn't love that 'build a statue / score a goal' task. Thought Ed's attempt saved the whole thing from being pretty forgettable.
10,d5uuqo_00011,Thought the recorded tasks were fairly average but the live task was one of the best I’ve seen
11,d5uuqo_00012,A quiet nerdy fuckwit. Bwhahaha
12,d5uuqo_00013,"Weakest of the three episodes so far. Not terrible, just a bit underpowered. None of the tasks were particularly memorable, though the contestants still had some fun with them."
13,d5uuqo_00014,"Maybe one of the weaker episodes so far. Felt more like series 8 vibe. Don’t know, juts didnt laugh as much on this one."
14,d5uuqo_00015,"Bit of a weaker episode. I thought the tasks were all a bit over contrived and that usually means they're less interesting. The two standout moments were David completely failing to hit the award, and then Greg playing his straight man part perfectly by starting Part 3 with ""we've just seen 3 people attempt to break and repair food, for some reason"""
15,d5uuqo_00016,"Alex absolutely pulled off ""hey guys"""
16,d5uuqo_00017,
17,d5uuqo_00018,"Just noticed at the end the Series Producer and Director are Andy Cartwright and Andy Devonshire -just like in Hot Fuzz, almost."
18,d5uuqo_00019,Wasn't it super obvious that they'd have had to memorise these? At least a couple of them saw it.
19,d5uuqo_00020,Ed's baby and the commentary had me in absolute stitches. Easily my favourite contestant so far this season. It's nice having two doses of him weekly on two of my favourite things: Taskmaster and Off Menu.
20,d5uuqo_00021,Howled with laughter at Ed having the bright idea to break up chocolate whilst also being stupid enough to break it into a chocolate jigsaw.
21,d5uuqo_00022,"I swear to the gooods when Ed's eyes lit up with ""BABYYYY!"" my imaginary ovaries almost exploded! 😍😍😍🤣🤣🤣"
22,d5uuqo_00023,Loving this series so far. Jo Brand not giving a single feck is killing me. She manages to do the tasks with the least amount of effort and still be funny. She seems to have the same ‘bosh’ approach as Kerry but none of the competitiveness. I’d never heard of Rose before but she’s a revelation. She’s had me howling every episode. I wasn’t a fan of David and wasn’t really aware of Katy but I’m loving them both too. I’d seen Ed’s show a few months back so assumed he would be my favourite as it was a great show. But Rose so far has taken that spot.
23,d5uuqo_00024,What is it with Ed and babies?
24,d5uuqo_00025,Reddit has been a right bellend tonight with these errors.
25,d5uuqo_00026,
26,d5uuqo_00027,"I fell in love with Katy when she came back wondering if she should memorise the hanging objects, but she's quite low energy so can get eclipsed by the other contestants. Hope she gets more time to shine."
27,d5uuqo_00028,"Not as strong as the other 2 episodes but still a very good episode, the Baddiel and Gamble banter is still going strong"
28,d5uuqo_00029,Can someone confirm or deny that Rose Matafeo was wearing a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure T-Shirt?
29,d5uuqo_00030,"As others have said, this episode felt a bit weaker, but my theory is if the location tasks aren't strong, the whole episode as a whole feels weak. I thought the prize task, studio banter, and live task were amongst the strongest to date, but the location tasks just fell relatively flat for the most part. Poor Katy though, she was very good this episode. I'd rewatch it just to watch her win her penis again, hahaha."
30,d5uuqo_00031,"I have two (yes, two) issues with the tasks in last night's episode. For the memory task, one of the things Alex said before he left the lab was ""don't sit down"". Every contestant sat down opposite Alex in the caravan. Should they have got a penalty for sitting down? Why was this not mentioned by anyone? 2. For the ""make a statue/score a goal"" task, the second part of the task simply said ""score a goal with this ball"". It made no mention whatsoever of the machine roller that Alex rode in on, nor that they had to use the roller to score the goal. Any contestant could have just got off the roller, walked up to the ball, and scored the goal with their feet thus protecting their statue. Why was this not mentioned by anyone? Previous tasks have sometimes had a twist. Something that the task specifically said, or something that the task specificaly did not say. The type of thing that, after we've seen the film of all 5 people doing thir tasks, Alex says ""well actually..."" and everyone (viewers, contestants, audience) go crazy over this small technicality that SUDDENLY CHANGES EVERYTHING. And despite TWO glaring opportunities for this in last night's episode, there was nothing. Nothing. Alex, you have let me down. Twice."
31,d5uuqo_00032,Is 9 points the most ever won for one task?
32,d5uuqo_00033,This is closing in on being my favorite cast to date. I naturally pick a favorite and least favorite early on and get irrationally grumpy when my least favorite always seems to win. So far I've just enjoyed watching this group.
33,d5uuqo_00034,"I usually watch this on UKTV Play with NordVPN, but tonight Nord was crazy slow and for the first time ever UKTV asked me to turn off adblockers(which it never used to!) and when I did that it kept asking me to sign up in, even though I already was. Luckily I found the episode on a torrent site."
34,d5uuqo_00035,Another corker of an episode.
35,d5uuqo_00036,"I'm worried it's only episode 3 and Jo seems to be losing steam already. I've never really enjoyed her style of not give a fuck comedy because to me it's a bit of a cop out. She's done some funny stuff in the tasks so hopefully that'll carry her through, but it feels like she's already over the studio part of the show. Don't want another Paul Sinha."
36,d5uuqo_00037,"...if I were Jewish with the last name Baddiel, I'd not call my kid Iva."
37,d5uuqo_00038,
38,d5uuqo_00039,
0,d8bbxr_00001,"Ed: I've got three sensitivity levels, and I'll be honest, I'm on my top f*cking one !!! What a quality outburst over buckaroo."
1,d8bbxr_00002,"ed’s water feature, jesus christ"
2,d8bbxr_00003,"I lost it at Katy's indifferent 'I don't care, don't tell me'! She is the dark horse of this series for me... the soft-spoken horse"
3,d8bbxr_00004,Having so many Q things added just in case somebody picks Q. All those Quavers.. I fucking love how the team thinks of everything before they give out a task.
4,d8bbxr_00005,Bwhaha! I love that Alex was ready for that joke!
5,d8bbxr_00006,I'm surprised no one made a Brokeback Fountain joke.
6,d8bbxr_00007,David is slowly becoming my favourite contestant. I actually think in some ways he might be the worst contestant yet through his combination of totally illogical thinking and old man dodderiness.
7,d8bbxr_00008,What a quepisode.
8,d8bbxr_00009,"Fantastic episode, one of my favourites. Katy's exchange with Alex regarding bullying was great."
9,d8bbxr_00010,Anyone else spot Alex’s Egg Gamble joke?
10,d8bbxr_00011,I wish I had as much excitement in life as Ed Gamble when he saw Alex using the mangle to produce the task
11,d8bbxr_00012,"The biggest challenge is, can they beat Rhod's water feature from series 7?"
12,d8bbxr_00013,Anyone else really want to play David's Nazi board game?
13,d8bbxr_00014,
14,d8bbxr_00015,Task: Impress a meercat
15,d8bbxr_00016,What a great ep!!! Loved the rubber egg! I can't get over Alex as a mermaid. And the song! Haha!
16,d8bbxr_00017,what a good episode! this series has been incredibly strong so far
17,d8bbxr_00018,"So Alex said there were apparently lots of ‘Q’ things in the house for the tray task. Which makes me wonder, did they also do the same for other uncommon letters like X or Z? Could we get a list from Alex somehow?"
18,d8bbxr_00019,Think this might be one of my favourite episodes.
19,d8bbxr_00020,Trick Egg!!!!!!!!!
20,d8bbxr_00021,Holy shit this series has been funny. I didn't know Katy Wix before this really but she cracks me up in the studio. I was not super excited about David Baddiel going into this but I am so glad he's there.
21,d8bbxr_00022,Is it just me or did Greg seem like he was off his tits?
22,d8bbxr_00023,Honestly one of the funniest ever live tasks. And Ed's water feature was hysterical.
23,d8bbxr_00024,I'd happily ride Ed Gamble
24,d8bbxr_00025,Ed gamble is very good this season. Always liked him from offmenu podcast but he's exceeded expectations this series!
25,d8bbxr_00026,I'm really excited for this board game task.
26,d8bbxr_00027,"With David this time, and at least one person on the beachball task last series, I'm genuinely surprised at how many people don't know how hose nozzles work."
27,d8bbxr_00028,Alex and David had a lot of fun in the water feature round.
28,d8bbxr_00029,"Ed’s water feature was up there with the cake sitting. Absolutely hysterical. But for some reason the bit I found funniest was Katy Wix saying ‘here comes the wine rack’ in a fake American accent. That killed me. The team tasks are genius this series. Not because the tasks themselves are amazing but because the difference in the teams attitudes is so gigantic, it’s cracks me right up."
29,d8bbxr_00030,What could be better than a mobility scooter?
30,d8bbxr_00031,Man this show gets me paranoid! I for sure thought there was going to be a twist about choosing the letters in TRAY or TASKMASTER-- with the camerawork zooming in on the word tray and task master during and before the task. Perhaps with a hidden rule written on the underside of the tray.
31,d8bbxr_00032,"I’m pretty certain their clothes are actually their clothes in the studio, but the stylist deserves five points for the way she got the panel to look this week. Rose’s matching outfit, Katy’s hair, shorts, and trainers, and Ed’s pooing jumper are definitely some of the best looks since Noel and Mel."
32,d8bbxr_00033,"Omg Ed is so suited to the Taskmaster format. He's hilarious on it. Ed has two settings: giggly excited child and feisty angry fighty child. There's no in-between. Also I love his interactions with others, especially Alex. It always feels like they're actual friends messing around."
33,d8bbxr_00034,"Good episode tonight, laughed much more, so much better than last week as well."
34,d8bbxr_00035,"I've seen a few rubber eggs in my life, and it's always been painfully obvious that they're not real eggs"
35,d8bbxr_00036,In case you missed it: the People's Champion vote is now open!
36,d8bbxr_00037,"Ed Gamble on all fours has got me all got and bothered! Daaaaaym. 🤤🤤🤤😂😂😂 Great episode! The ""letter of the alphabet"" thing with Ed was just beyond funny. And yaaaas to Alex's dadbod. 😅😅😅😅😅"
37,d8bbxr_00038,So are we all chipping in for Alex Horne's therapy sessions after Ed's done with him
38,d8bbxr_00039,Surely 'Alex singing like a mermaid in a squirting funnel bra' is going into the Taskmaster Hall Of Fame?
39,d8bbxr_00040,I'm trying to figure out what game David referenced at the beginning of the board game task.
40,d8bbxr_00041,This is without a doubt my favourite series so far. So many moments in this episode had me laughing.
41,d8bbxr_00042,This series is so much better than series 8. David Baddiel f-cking it up yet again by choosing Q says it all really.
42,d8bbxr_00043,
0,dirh86_00001,I have less and less of a clue as to how David's mind works as the weeks go by. He's completely lost it.
1,dirh86_00002,That prize task was incredible. All amazing entries in different ways.
2,dirh86_00003,I was at the live recording for this one. I’m so surprised that so much funny stuff got cut out! At the end Greg took his trousers off and was wearing trunks that he stole from Ed when they were at the Hot tub party thing. They talked for at least 10 minutes on David at Buckingham palace. The Live task lasted about 25mins as well! Greg made a really funny joke about Ed’s fiancee on Mt.Rushmore explaining that she only had four strands of hair as well. Interestinh to see how they cut it down. Brilliant episode none the less.
3,dirh86_00004,Every time I see a laminator in the lidl special buys aisle I think of Greg and Kerry
4,dirh86_00005,Ooh dear... I thought Rose was being really smart.... but Alex was 2 steps ahead LOL
5,dirh86_00006,"holy shit, jo on the live task"
6,dirh86_00007,"I really missed Katy Wix from the live shows. Glad she's back. ""it wasn't a compliment"""
7,dirh86_00008,"I love that the more p*ssed off Jo got at Greg giving her pitty points, the more points she got. YOU GO JO BRAND!"
8,dirh86_00009,I wish I had never had to hear David Baddiel softly whispering 'oh fuck please' as he struggled to get that stick through his ring
9,dirh86_00010,"Did Alex just call Ed ""Egg""? I feel this has happened before. A secret task perhaps."
10,dirh86_00011,Godliman!
11,dirh86_00012,This guesswork from Jo is amazing christ
12,dirh86_00013,I genuinely have no idea why I fancy Katie Wix so much
13,dirh86_00014,"We were lucky enough to be at this taping and we were given the postcards as souvenirs! We scanned them at the highest resolution we could, so if you'd like them here they are! https://www.reddit.com/r/taskmaster/comments/dix61r/mount_rushmore_postcards_hq_scans/"
14,dirh86_00015,The Dacia adverts irritate me so much. Voiceover chap has such a smug tone.
15,dirh86_00016,I think my workplace needs a game of Horse or Laminator.
16,dirh86_00017,That ring on the finger stuff better not awaken anything in me...
17,dirh86_00018,"I thought Jo not giving a fuck would get old, but it's brilliant. I loved how angry she got during the egg-pipe task."
18,dirh86_00019,Wow the series scores are looking so tight now.
19,dirh86_00020,I'm still laughing at Alex's spontaneous African elephant impression! aaAAAAH
20,dirh86_00021,I'm glad I'm not the only one that calls themselves a stupid twat when they realize they've done something stupid. Lol
21,dirh86_00022,I don't think I've ever seen Alex laugh as much during the gold ring task with Katy and Jo
0,dm22bc_00001,I absolutely adore the way Rose says shed. Lol
1,dm22bc_00002,
2,dm22bc_00003,I think I'm a little bit in love with Rose. I'd not heard of her coming into this series but she never fails to put a smile on my face and she's one of my all time faves. Also I adore the Kiwi accent (it turns out)
3,dm22bc_00004,"The reveal of David's drawing in the live task had me in tears in a way that's only matched by Bobs mask from Champion of Champions Also every episode my crush on Rose grows stronger, I love this mad Kiwi woman"
4,dm22bc_00005,Rose's notes on the theme tune task if anyone's interested - https://twitter.com/Rose_Matafeo/status/1187122725422292992?s=19
5,dm22bc_00006,DEDICATION DAVID!!!! Ed and David's banter is one of the many things making this series my favourite of all TM
6,dm22bc_00007,How did David not win that final live task?
7,dm22bc_00008,"I rarely burst out laughing but davids mask got me, and eds reaction to it. looked like mr blobby"
8,dm22bc_00009,I feel a sense of immense national pride seeing That Fish Poster as a prize on this show.
9,dm22bc_00010,"""Thanks for colonizing us by the way"""
10,dm22bc_00011,Anything Rose repeats is automatically funny because of her accent.
11,dm22bc_00012,"Anyone else notice btw that Greg is awarding a lot more people joint positions this series over the traditional, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th? Like every episode it feels has two contestants being awarded the same amount of points for a task"
12,dm22bc_00013,"Great episode, probably the best of the series? I loved Greg’s line about David having the extra challenge of being David Baddiel. The Foley sound effect task was great, but specially Jo and David’s. I wish they’d (also) shown us the finished film with sound effects, without seeing the contestants’ doing the effects. I think Jo and David’s would have been especially funny, when David started saying the actions out loud."
13,dm22bc_00014,"Did Greg throw full shade at Jo when he joked that someone at work called him fat and it was Jo Brand? I heard it as it was insult to injury because she's overweight herself. Did I hear that right? Because if so, damn she took it in stride."
14,dm22bc_00015,"Clearly a tiny nail gun, not a tiny drill!"
15,dm22bc_00016,"I love Rose SO much, she's wonderful"
16,dm22bc_00017,Might be because I’m a little drunk but that was one of the funniest ever shows for me. I think I love Rose as well.
17,dm22bc_00018,Funniest part of the episode for me was Ed giggling like a schoolboy and telling Jo she was gonna get merked after her theme tune
18,dm22bc_00019,"Has anyone got a screenshot of Rose's cross eyed face when she has to say shed instead of shid? It's about 3:36 on the UKTV player video, but when I pause it on my phone the preview box of other videos comes up :( ."
19,dm22bc_00020,"So what was on the top part of the window before Ed hit it with the golf ball? There wasn't something on the corresponding window. Who were the other people in Jo's theme tune? Crew? I know people have said that Alex uses a bell for David...I saw the bell this week in the bin task, but last week Alex was using a whistle for the rings task."
20,dm22bc_00021,
21,dm22bc_00022,Does anyone know when the mirror links will be out?
0,dpdjqr_00001,David was hilarious in that final task
1,dpdjqr_00002,"""Is it them as crisps?"" is possibly my favourite line of the series. Lovely Katy, a little too subtle for the bombast of the show sometimes."
2,dpdjqr_00003,Those were my most favourite advert transitions across all series. Loved that video game theme!
3,dpdjqr_00004,NOOO I'm not ready for E10
4,dpdjqr_00005,"I don't care that David was clearly put on Ed's team so he could win the episode, he's finally won one! Let's hope Ed has quite a poor episode so Rose and Katy can catch up for a 3 way fight in the final task next week. This series has definitely had the best final tasks of the whole lot, not one that I can remember has been poor."
5,dpdjqr_00006,"Rose running underneath that rock might be the series highlight for me, if nothing beats it next week. My vision was fully blurred by tears once they cut back to the studios."
6,dpdjqr_00007,Jo demanding lots of sweets and then just sitting there looking expectant while little Alex Horne came scurrying up to her with them made my evening. She really couldn’t care less and I love that about her!
7,dpdjqr_00008,"I love the chemistry between this line-up. It's the friendliest it's been since about Series 4. And yeah, Ed losing his shit in the live task was great. And yay Baddiel! I was really hoping for him during that task."
8,dpdjqr_00009,"Best prize task ever. Another really good episode, from Greg's intro all the way through"
9,dpdjqr_00010,"LMAO Jo telling the audience to fuck off, killed me"
10,dpdjqr_00011,That was one of the best final tasks I've ever seen - Ed's growing anger with David absolutely made it
11,dpdjqr_00012,That final task was right up there. Eds frustration made it all the more hilarious
12,dpdjqr_00013,Ed's build-up and the end result of his knees is the grimmest thing of the entire show ever.
13,dpdjqr_00014,“The Two Ron-knees” “Elbow-lyn” Even the shit jokes are great in Series 9.
14,dpdjqr_00015,It's been a while since I have seen a series with such consistently good final live tasks.
15,dpdjqr_00016,"I'm really gonna miss this group of contestants. They're such a good mix and I've really enjoyed this season. We've had a great variation of response to all the tasks and their chemistries are amazing even when they're supposed to be arguing or angry with each other. It just seems like friends fighting with friends and you never doubt that. Also it just goes to show that if David actually goes through one episode without getting disqualified in a task, he would have actually had a chance of winning (an episode). Also I haven't cried laughing in pain for a while from taskmaster and that live task and the David-Ed team up was so so so good."
0,kaonrr_00001,"Thanks for posting this! I had scheduled a post, reddit said no and I was.... at the pub having a substantial meal 👀"
1,kaonrr_00002,"""What's a tusk?"" ""Fuck off, I'm not telling you."""
2,kaonrr_00003,"Mawaan: incredible bit of both cheeky doorbell-theft shenanigans and practical consideration of the frailty of the structural materials he had to hand on the beer mat task, incredible, 11/10, what a brain on the lad. Also Mawaan: sees a 1 metre cube full of teeny-tiny balls, somehow comes to the conclusion there are 150 balls in the thing despite noting the fact that there are probably that amount in the top two layers alone."
3,kaonrr_00004,I love that in the very first task they ever did Katherine was enlisting Alex’s help. She decided straight away he would be her little helper
4,kaonrr_00005,"When Katherine said she thought the lighthouse was a windmill, I died laughing!"
5,kaonrr_00006,"This has got to be one of my favourite episodes of the entire show! Some of the moments made me scream-laugh in a way I have never done before. Daisy eating the banana, Johnny's sad DNA and overall nightmare of a time, 'Fuck off I'm not telling you' - this is an instant classic."
6,kaonrr_00007,"I wept for Johnny Vegas twice in this episode. The sad-clown pathos of both the ball task and the beer mat task was just...stunning. His genuine despair when that beautiful structure collapsed, I couldn't bear it...I don't know how Greg can live with himself after the no-points decision"
7,kaonrr_00008,I know people don't like the complicated tasks but I thought the door one was pretty good
8,kaonrr_00009,omg the applause when Daisy the Psychotic Tiger absolutely destroyed that banana
9,kaonrr_00010,"I outright shouted ""NOOOOO"" when Mawaan overstepped the line. I'm rooting for him so hard after that amazing show with the beer mat tower!"
10,kaonrr_00011,So when can we buy the Greg and Alex pillows
11,kaonrr_00012,"These tasks feel meaner and more directly humiliating. As someone said in the sub, a lot of the lateral thinking opportunities are gone and most tasks just seem like ‘Do an almost impossible linear thing in too short a time’. Still a lot of laughs, but don’t feel much of the warmth towards this series as the previous 5 years."
12,kaonrr_00013,I gasped when Johnny dismissed the matchbox because I just knew the number would be in there.
13,kaonrr_00014,So the best way to do the doors was in order right? Throw 10 yellow things Kick 3 orange things Put your shoes in the bucket Sit on the bucket and peel an orange and banana Eat a whole banana
14,kaonrr_00015,"The beer mat house building is a good example of a task being overly complicated. For everyone but Mawaan it quickly descended into Alex just telling them when to run to the door. Katherines attempt in particular was really awkward to watch, she looked genuinely defeated after it finished."
15,kaonrr_00016,Was there anything stopping them just taking the beer mats and making the house near the front door? Although Mawaan’s hack was obviously much better than that
16,kaonrr_00017,Daisy May is clearly Greg's favourite this series. Today's examples being clean sheets (was sold well but incredibly unimaginative) and her house was much worse than Richards.
17,kaonrr_00018,
18,kaonrr_00019,"I loved how even from their very first task, you could tell exactly how all of them were going to approach the show. Overall brilliant episode with SOME ACTUAL FUN BANTER Also, I'm calling it here, tie between Richard and Daisy as series winner. It's 2020 and I honestly wouldn't discount it happening."
19,kaonrr_00020,"My heart broke for Johnny twice this episode, I can barely stand it. Poor thing. I think I'm going to be disappointed next week, but I guess it's not about who wins, it's about the friends we made along the way."
20,kaonrr_00021,"""oh wow, it's a windmill"" THIS IS WHY KATHERINE IS MY FAVORITE."
21,kaonrr_00022,
22,kaonrr_00023,"I never expected this series to become what it has, a Wagnerian power struggle between Richard’s steel-eyed Wotan and Daisy’s passionate Brunhilde. Thrilling stuff."
23,kaonrr_00024,Richard Herrings bedsheets have catapulted to the top of my Christmas wish list
24,kaonrr_00025,"I know it's episode 9 and this has probably been mentioned, but god, I'm so pleased Channel 4 don't squish the credits like Dave did."
25,kaonrr_00026,Does it seem to anyone else like there's a lot of drawing final tasks this series?
26,kaonrr_00027,Johnny is so heartbreaking. I’d tell Alex to give him a cuddle but I know he doesn’t like being touched.
27,kaonrr_00028,At this point i feel like daisy could shit in a glass and greg would give her 3 points haha
28,kaonrr_00029,"I have understood why Joe Wilkinson didnt get the points for potato gate. But today Johnny's Vegas Villas need some justice!! I am sad for him #PatheticDNA P.S. I have never hated on a TM champion, just argued for my favorites etc. But now I am hating on Ed Gamble saying JV doesn't deserve points! #OneMoreEpisodeForNewChampion"
29,kaonrr_00030,The in-studio banter seems to be improving.
30,kaonrr_00031,air horn andy!!
31,kaonrr_00032,
32,kaonrr_00033,That was possibly my favourite ever episode. It had it all. I was laughing harder than I can remember every laughing at TM. So so so good
33,kaonrr_00034,"I said ""oh wow, it's a windmill""... Never change, Katherine."
34,kaonrr_00035,"""She fell for our baking tray cupboard trick."""
35,kaonrr_00036,"So for the multi-door task, was there anything stopping the contestants from repeating a door until they succeeded? Also, what's up with all the studio drawing tasks? I swear we've had 3 or 4 already this series."
36,kaonrr_00037,Johnny does every task like he'll be killed if he fails.
37,kaonrr_00038,i think taskmaster is at it's best when the tasks are open to interpretation and the contestants can show off their creativity and the struggle is part of the fun. this series seems a bit too much like just forcing people to do inane bs and is not that much fun.
38,kaonrr_00039,The fact that the air horn was not a blow up doll of Alex has disappointed me
39,kaonrr_00040,Are there less people watching and commenting tonight or are there multiple threads?
40,kaonrr_00041,I don't think I've seen another episode when a contestant had as low a number as 3(!) points that Katharine had going in to the live task. The selection of tasks for this episode did her dirty.
41,kaonrr_00042,"Very good final stage task, that's one that could work at home very well. Finally cracked Katherines stage persona and her real one came out with the Tusk thing! The beer mats too, nice one Mawaan. I knew there would be a way around it - probably would have taken the table and beermats outside myself. Katherine proving again she's rubbish and thinks Alex is her helper. Her agent is not going to like her performance on this! The gates, bit of a hard task, bit too complicated I think. Balls were very good. Katherine starting as she means to go on, by not reading the task and enlisting Alex for everything :P"
42,kaonrr_00043,"So, from the wording of the house task, I think a valid method would be to: Ignore the first bell. Let it go off. Build a house. Then go ring the bell and sit there for 15 minutes ringing the bell. The timing seems to be from when the bell rings. So you fail one, which is allowed, then ring whenever you're ready to start the 58 seconds."
43,kaonrr_00044,Where can i purchase Mawaan’s Canadian monster!? That was so good! 😂😂😂
44,kaonrr_00045,"I feel broken-hearted for Johnny. He's come so close only to stumble so many times it seems like, and he gets so invested in what he's doing, poor thing."
45,kaonrr_00046,Richard Herring must be a nervous wreck right now I think he NEEDS this series win given he's been dreaming of it for 5 years
46,kaonrr_00047,"The balls count, I wouldn't necessarily have tried removing them to count, but I immediately would've stuck my arm down into the middle because I'd just be assuming at this point Alex would've buried an empty box within to take up volume but amount to nothing. It would seem he very much went the other direction lol It's a small thing, but I was a little surprised at Daisy, she was alert enough to automatically take the bucket with her on the 'numbered doors' bit, but when using it to sit down I'd have thought she'd do it with it right side up. She'd still probably be able to straddle the top and it keeps all the items in for the time being. This was an excessively convoluted and hard one to do, it actually reminded me a little of what is easily my least favorite task in the show's history. At least, going by how genuinely pissed off I would've been there in the moment myself. It was one of the team tasks in series 8, where they had like 4 different sets of rules they had to learn in literally a matter of seconds for what to do with all the types of balls that were going to be thrown at them within the house's yard, not even knowing from where the (multiple) spots the balls would be thrown. And those things were fired at them fast as shit. It was like catch one color in a specific receptacle, one color bounce off you then onto the ground, one color you couldn't let hit you at all, etc. It was so over the top absurd, you had zero chance of getting anywhere even close to a comprehensive score aside from anything than dumb luck. And it wasn't even fun to watch."
47,kaonrr_00048,Daisy not breaking her quite horrific prize task entrants streak. Literally whatever she could see on her way out of the house! You love to see it!
48,kaonrr_00049,"Episode title should have been either ""Oh wow, it's a windmill"" or ""So be it"""
49,kaonrr_00050,"I had the directly opposite idea of Mawaan's. My first thought was to move the table outside (it should be able to fit out of the double doors to the left in that room) and set it down right by the front door of the house. Start messing with the cards for ""the house"" right there with the bell in arm's reach."
50,kaonrr_00051,"Katherine is my favorite contestant in studio but I find her frustrating during tasks. It seems like she's just intentionally pretending to be dim, because I don't believe she could actually be like that in real life. I felt the same about David Badiel by the end of last season."
51,kaonrr_00052,"This episode really didn't work for me. It seemed to go beyond 'fun and stupid' and into 'unreasonable and tortuous'. I felt sorry for Kathrine with the doorbell task. The doors task was not much better. No ingenuity involved, just trying to do what was more or less impossible."
52,kaonrr_00053,"Great Episode. Johnny's tragic cards falling and him begging were glorious. Katherine's ""Fuck off, i'm not telling you"" was so unexpected, and her chemistry with Alex is unmatched. Bref, there's only episode left and it's a really tight race."
53,kaonrr_00054,
54,kaonrr_00055,My heart can’t take how tragic Johnny’s efforts become on this series
55,kaonrr_00056,"A'ight? It's been nearly a week and sorry if someones mentioned this already but i was just rewatching the beer mat house task and realised; Alex doesn't restart the clock (ever decreasing durations) until the contestant RETURNS from ringing the doorbell and they were allowed two timing mistakes. They could have just ignored the first bell time, taken as long as they wanted to build their beer mat house, THEN went out and just did all the successive rings. Am i missing something or would this be within the rules?"
56,kaonrr_00057,
57,kaonrr_00058,Taskmaster: Going Mental
58,kaonrr_00059,"I want that door bell, I'm in Canada any ideas?"
0,kev9j9_00001,Mawaan holding up his chair upside down: LOOK A CAT
1,kev9j9_00002,This season has just been a ten hour long visual documentation of Katherine Parkinson losing her mind
2,kev9j9_00003,Mawaan's the best thing to come out of 2020 for me ngl
3,kev9j9_00004,The RAGE on Daisy Mays' face as she ripped open a grapefruit with her teeth...astonishing.
4,kev9j9_00005,I don’t remember if it was in the show or on the podcast but Alex mentioned that Katherine often thought she couldn’t leave the starting room... that explains this task
5,kev9j9_00006,I think Katherine has been irreversibly changed by the Taskmaster experience
6,kev9j9_00007,"Although not everyone loves Richard I feel he really represents how a true fan would go for it, and he wanted it more than any contestant ever"
7,kev9j9_00008,I think Katherine has now officially lost her mind
8,kev9j9_00009,Daisy rage quitting was a sight to behold
9,kev9j9_00010,"""Am I the Spider?"" ""No"" ""I could be if you wanted me to be"""
10,kev9j9_00011,"Katherine is so bad at this show that when she rooted for Daisy, Daisy destroyed her pasta biscuit bridge and her chances of winning."
11,kev9j9_00012,"I'd been rooting for Mawaan all season, but bless Richard. He's wanted to be on the show for years, absolutely adores it, and it'll be great to see him and Ed together if CoC 2 happens."
12,kev9j9_00013,Am I the spider? - Katherine Parkinson
13,kev9j9_00014,"""He took charge in this one and suddenly I had respect for him I've never had before or after"" Lmfao Daisy ruined Richard there"
14,kev9j9_00015,"Richard may have won the series, but Katherine won my heart"
15,kev9j9_00016,I've never felt happier for someone than Katherine getting those 5 points
16,kev9j9_00017,Daisy struggling to say phenomenons is a big mood
17,kev9j9_00018,Katherine noticing the hangers after she completed the task just feels right
18,kev9j9_00019,"""I've grown very fond of you but they're rubbish"" Greg doesn't hold back lmao"
19,kev9j9_00020,If you told me during episode one that the season finale would show Johnny Vegas having a breakdown and collapsing atop a giant spider I’d have believed it instantly.
20,kev9j9_00021,"You can see exactly where daisy's heart breaks, she really was trying the whole time :("
21,kev9j9_00022,Can you believe they found a contestant more awkward than Joe Thomas?
22,kev9j9_00023,Wish Mawaan would’ve at least won the episode :(
23,kev9j9_00024,Katherine's dancing has me legit wondering if she just turned up to every task slightly tipsy...
24,kev9j9_00025,Dogmeat trifle absolutely shafted
25,kev9j9_00026,Electronic voice phenomonenm9neonms
26,kev9j9_00027,Katherine getting the final five points in the pre-recorded tasks just feels right
27,kev9j9_00028,"Aw, bless his heart, he's so pleased to have won, good on him. (The unsuppressed rage on Daisy-Mays' face as she failed at the very last hurdle does make me fear for Richard if he happens to be walking through a car park at night in the near future though)"
28,kev9j9_00029,I'm still trying to process Katherine's thought process with the spider task tbh
29,kev9j9_00030,Mawaan makes a great hype man
30,kev9j9_00031,Good to see that the Final Task of Undressing Bernard made a full 60% of the contestants ABSOLUTELY LOSE THE FUCKING PLOT.
31,kev9j9_00032,Look it's a cat!
32,kev9j9_00033,This is the first time in the history of the show I’ve actually been nervous about the series result
33,kev9j9_00034,Oh Mummy
34,kev9j9_00035,Richard sticking up for Katherine so that she gets more points than Daisy (potentially) is a good move
35,kev9j9_00036,Richard has been kind to Katherine this episode! #RespectRegained
36,kev9j9_00037,"With Katherine's workaround, we are back to the age old, overarching question of this show. When is a step not a step? And naturally the answer is when it's on a fucking hurdle."
37,kev9j9_00038,Emojars are great. Mawaan continues to be amazing
38,kev9j9_00039,Absolutely gutted for DMC.
39,kev9j9_00040,ah I feel kinda bad for Katherine! Greg proper ripping into the masks haha
40,kev9j9_00041,I would not have expected Richard and Daisy’s entry to actually be good! But damn!
41,kev9j9_00042,Is katherine ok? What is she doing ?????
42,kev9j9_00043,Katherine is having a breakdown :D
43,kev9j9_00044,Katherine why are you so weird
44,kev9j9_00045,If Katherine does not murder Greg by the end of the episode then I will be very surprised. She is Just So Done.
45,kev9j9_00046,"I mean this with no offence or disrespect, but I really feel that Richard may be the only winner of a series who really made no real impact throughout"
46,kev9j9_00047,Is... is Katherine crying?
47,kev9j9_00048,"If not for her anger, we would have seen series tiebreak!!"
48,kev9j9_00049,I think i will miss Johnny's unrelenting despair the most. He was such a 2020 vibe.
49,kev9j9_00050,
50,kev9j9_00051,"Series 11 cast just announced: Charlotte Ritchie, Lee Mack, Mike Wozniak, Sarah Kendall and Jamali Maddix!!"
51,kev9j9_00052,"So sad to say goodbye to this season’s contestants, they just have so much fun"
52,kev9j9_00053,Ahahaha Katherine emphasising THE over and over again
53,kev9j9_00054,My favorite part about this season of Taskmaster is the revelation that Katherine Parkinson is totally insane.
54,kev9j9_00055,Katherine: Ah... I know exactly what's going on. Narrator: She doesn't.
55,kev9j9_00056,Will the Season 11 contestants be revealed after the credits? or will it just be a trailer for the New Years special? Will there be anything? AND WHO WILL WIN.... aaahahhhhhhhhh
56,kev9j9_00057,The impossible chaos that Mawaan and Johnny bring to the tasks in their respective ways is just magical.
57,kev9j9_00058,My boy! My boy! My beautiful boy!
58,kev9j9_00059,"Entire bit of Katherine and Lord Davies conversation is gold! ""Are we cool now?"" ""Apology Accepted"""
59,kev9j9_00060,Richard winning makes me annoyed because he is going to be so smug about it
60,kev9j9_00061,The curse of the first seat strikes again...
61,kev9j9_00062,Katherine has hands down been my favourite this season. Hopefully we get next seasons cast announced at the end and it's a good cast.
62,kev9j9_00063,No milk for naughty boys.
63,kev9j9_00064,I apologise for any transgressions. Also for using you as a hook. - Richard to Bernard lmao
64,kev9j9_00065,"Mawaan outfit watch : a strong showing to end the season on. Teal blue and purple is a very ""early 1990s shell suit"" combination, but he pulls it off."
65,kev9j9_00066,Flashbacks to Katherine singing in the it crowd
66,kev9j9_00067,This is fast becoming my favourite episode this series. I love Alex falling asleep so much it hurts.
67,kev9j9_00068,Nooo Daisy whyyy :( my heart
68,kev9j9_00069,"Holy fuck, Johnny, Katherine and Mawaan's karaoke performance is one of the greatest things I've seen. ""Katherine, you went through a lot of genres and you were so genuinely into it that I suspect that a lot of your friends were at home rolling their eyes because they've seen that before."" [Katherine nods sheepishly]"
69,kev9j9_00070,"""Jay-Z's seminal classic 99 problems"""
70,kev9j9_00071,"Mawaan, Daisy and Johnny deserved the win there, but it's Greg's decision, so fine. My only issue is - why is it a 5/2 point split instead of the usual 3/2?"
71,kev9j9_00072,Katherine was adorable this episode Immediately singing along before they even started the task Sitting on Bernard's lap and ending with 'I've had a really nice time'. So lovely
72,kev9j9_00073,Hold on...the spider's leg came off. Snap them off and take them to the wellies would work right?
73,kev9j9_00074,“It almost sounded like a ghost!”
74,kev9j9_00075,"I'm also glad we've finally had an Asian guy on the show who's not been completely shit @ Nish, Romesh, Paul, Asim Somehow confused Asim with Romesh??"
75,kev9j9_00076,Ahahahahahaha omg I thought Johnny's breakdown was good This is the best thing I've seen all year lmfao
76,kev9j9_00077,Daisy crushing the grape fruit is clasic
77,kev9j9_00078,I love Katherine
78,kev9j9_00079,Alex's song was 10/10
79,kev9j9_00080,
80,kev9j9_00081,He's only gone and bloody done it! YES!!!
81,kev9j9_00082,Greg Davies: THANKS CAPITALISM
82,kev9j9_00083,THATS WHAT KATHERINE DESERVES
83,kev9j9_00084,Katherine just wasn’t made for this world was she...she is amazing to behold
84,kev9j9_00085,Emo-jars are actually good!
85,kev9j9_00086,This choreo is AMAZING
86,kev9j9_00087,Daisy's reaction to losing :D
87,kev9j9_00088,Now this is the sort of thing I want to see in a task
88,kev9j9_00089,A song team task This should be really fun
89,kev9j9_00090,158 to 162 what a final sprint
90,kev9j9_00091,"I grew to enjoy the contestents a lot and I think this ended up being a really strong case. Mawaan probably the break out star and i'll keep an eye out for him in the future but they all bought something. For the first time though, I think the show was let down by the tasks overall this series. The in-studio ones had too many stinkers (both bringing something in prompts were weak, and some really poor last tasks). The outside ones had too many where either/or you got disqualified for one minor mistake, or it was a countdown with very little time which rarely lends itself to original out the box thinking."
91,kev9j9_00092,"Scores as of the start of this episode, for others keeping track per task: edit: Third commercial break 143 147 152 145 146 149 134 139 143 130 133 133 108 110 111"
92,kev9j9_00093,It's shit but it's her best yet.
93,kev9j9_00094,The hands on the hips couldn't make Richard more smug if he tried
94,kev9j9_00095,Really glad Richard won in the end as he's a big fan.
95,kev9j9_00096,"Oh my God, Katherine Parkinson having a slow mental breakdown over the philosophical question of where the spider is, though."
96,kev9j9_00097,Omg Richard's acting break I forgot all about the masturbator
97,kev9j9_00098,I’m so excited for Katherine’s attempt at this
98,kev9j9_00099,This is going to be horrendous. In the best way.
99,kev9j9_00100,"I really hope Rich is as angry as I am about how over-scored Daisy has been this series,"
100,kev9j9_00101,Can I just say... Richard doing the AMA completely spoiled the winner imo
101,kev9j9_00102,JUSTICE FOR DMC
102,kev9j9_00103,Fun fact: the karaoke song was written by Will Collier who is one of the Horne Section (which is why they’d never heard of it before). It did have a very Horne Section vibe to it.
103,kev9j9_00104,Taskmaster's on! It's is on now!
104,kev9j9_00105,My heart weeps for Johnny
105,kev9j9_00106,Richard and Daisy got MOVES
106,kev9j9_00107,"Likely it’s just me but I thought the quality of tonight’s episode was wildly above the preceding ones. I saw this one in the cinema and thought it was funny at the time, so I was disappointed with the other episodes as they aired, while I still found this one quite funny."
107,kev9j9_00108,
108,kev9j9_00109,Electronic voice thermmonimoms
109,kev9j9_00110,I feel so grateful to watch TM history being made live
110,kev9j9_00111,There goes another candidate whom I root for - not winning the taskmaster!
111,kev9j9_00112,"Johnny's dole comment made me howl, classic British humour right there."
112,kev9j9_00113,I love that they took so many short cuts but their complete lack of urgency fucks them up lol
113,kev9j9_00114,Johnny's meltdown makes this task worth it
114,kev9j9_00115,Johnny was robbed
115,kev9j9_00116,Bernard's really been through it
116,kev9j9_00117,I’m amazed “fishing for hats” actually worked
117,kev9j9_00118,Johnny needs this
118,kev9j9_00119,Aesthetically so pleasing!
119,kev9j9_00120,Yes! My boy! Herring won!
120,kev9j9_00121,"A really nice time, all you could want"
121,kev9j9_00122,Something about everyone not hugging and celebrating together really broke my heart
122,kev9j9_00123,Daisy losing her shit and destroying the task right at the end after she knew she'd bottled it was fucking hilarious.
123,kev9j9_00124,Did Katherine's kids make those?
124,kev9j9_00125,Is Daisys going to be Gu ramekins?
125,kev9j9_00126,phenononons
126,kev9j9_00127,When the commercial is voiced by Katherine Parkinson
127,kev9j9_00128,Katherine is jamming
128,kev9j9_00129,Are they drunk?
129,kev9j9_00130,“A clean room is a clean mind”
130,kev9j9_00131,Oh noooo my beautiful boy!!
131,kev9j9_00132,Oh daisy good lord
132,kev9j9_00133,"This was a solid finale! Happy Richard won since he's been wanting to be a part of the show for a while. Happy Mawan got to shine a bit, he's probably my favorite contestant this series. And happy-sad for the trainwreck that is Katherine, good lord."
133,kev9j9_00134,"Okay, maybe I'm just a cranky skeptical bastard, but there's no way Daisy's EVP was better than Johnny's pub signs."
134,kev9j9_00135,"""Johnny, I wrote down, was 'simultaneously channelling Pavarotti, Joe Cocker, and that man that stands outside the off-license trying to fight a bin'."""
135,kev9j9_00136,
136,kev9j9_00137,"I predict mawaan will win the episode, no idea about the series!!"
137,kev9j9_00138,"I hope there's some level of diversity in the others performances, otherwise this doesnt seem the greatest task :/"
138,kev9j9_00139,Both Mawaan and Johnny got distracted lmao
139,kev9j9_00140,Daisys robot dance moves are amazing
140,kev9j9_00141,Loved Richard's dancing. I actually really enjoy their team
141,kev9j9_00142,"Isn't it ""phenomena"" ?"
142,kev9j9_00143,We finally see how Daisy treats men in her life.
143,kev9j9_00144,I have properly loved this series <3
144,kev9j9_00145,"Something to point out, I'm pretty sure this series winner won the most episodes of any champion in their respective series. 5 episodes. Nearest to that was Ed who won 4. I think they also got the second highest single episode score of any champ, beat only by Katherine due to the bunny hat fiasco. She got 30 points, S10 champ got 26 in a single episode"
145,kev9j9_00146,I was wondering who would be the first to just bring the legs into the room
146,kev9j9_00147,Katherine trying to figure out what the spider was meant to be is the hardest I laughed in quite some time
147,kev9j9_00148,"get you a friend that defends you the way richard defends katherine now if you'll excuse me, i'm off to watch the it crowd for the third time"
148,kev9j9_00149,i wish daisy would have won but i also am glad that if she was gunna bow out she did it with absolutely no grace and it was hilarious to watch.
149,kev9j9_00150,I'm going to miss Johnny's weekly existential breakdowns
150,kev9j9_00151,I loved Katherine before this series. Now I love her even more for some reason.
151,kev9j9_00152,Johnny hanging Bernard on the clothing rack by his elongated neck might be the funniest part of the season. Oh my god.
152,kev9j9_00153,So hyped that I registered for All 4 from US and got VPN to work as well! #S10.
153,kev9j9_00154,Did the tasks say you couldn’t cut the string?
154,kev9j9_00155,I actually like this ngl The dance was lovely
155,kev9j9_00156,Daisy decapitated Bernard!
156,kev9j9_00157,Possibility of Season 11 lineup announcement after the credits?
157,kev9j9_00158,"Pumped for Richard. Wasnt the most chaotic/stand out of the line up, but love his personality and was rooting for him throughout."
158,kev9j9_00159,
159,kev9j9_00160,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series. One of the best characteristics of this particular series was the diversity of the contestants and their approaches to the show. Johnny was pure chaos, especially when he tried. Richard really wanted to win. DMC was a revelation in her tenacity and, at times, rage. Mawaan was just going with the flow and whatever popped into his head. And lovely Katherine, so completely out of her depth."
160,kev9j9_00161,Team task Yay more Daisy and Richard meltdown
161,kev9j9_00162,This is now a Richard Herring stan account 🦀🦀
162,kev9j9_00163,When daisy was fishing for hats I was genuinely worried she may go into labour
163,kev9j9_00164,"First series I’ve watched as it’s happened, been meaning to get into it for years. But yeah thoroughly enjoyed it, glad Richard won he’s got this very Everyman quality to him and a childlike innocence and optimism! But they were all great, can’t wait for more."
164,kev9j9_00165,"I loved that spider task. Silly, fun, can be done very straightforward or a little more creative. Or completely disastrous... I'm also admiring how Daisy completely gave up in the final studio task. Such a 2020 mood. I do think this series has suffered a bit from the pandemic and the tasks not being as good earlier series but I did really enjoy it. The best thing for me was discovering Mawaan, who I'd never heard of before. And I'm so glad we have so much upcoming stuff to look forward to!"
165,kev9j9_00166,Here's Richard's Watchalong of episode 10 on Twitch in case someone's interested.
166,kev9j9_00167,I swear every season I absolutely love the show but my least favorite contestant always wins.
167,kev9j9_00168,"Come on, Daisy!"
168,kev9j9_00169,Oh god this is close!
169,kev9j9_00170,"So, no big reveal on S11 then"
170,kev9j9_00171,Wondering how much the group tasks for the two on the lead being pre covid made a difference
171,kev9j9_00172,Greeg's response to Katherine's prize task I expected them to be better than they are Sums up my feelings about all of the contestants during the whole season. It's been glorious and I think definitely in contention for best series.
172,kev9j9_00173,"Great Finale. Katherine overthinking the spider task was hysterical. I was confident Richard would win, since Daisy crumbled under pressure and fucked up. Solid Series overall. It's been quite enjoyable watching it on a regular basis."
173,kev9j9_00174,I'm sure one of the boots on Daisy's spider came off.
174,kev9j9_00175,"""Biscuit driven plop..."""
175,kev9j9_00176,Bernard’s clothes task made me laugh the hardest I have this whole series! I can see why they saved it for last.
176,kev9j9_00177,Richard is now the winningest contestant ever - he won five episodes. Ed was the former record-holder with four.
177,kev9j9_00178,"I got so into the details of finishing off my ""solo tasks"" supercut I'd completely forgotten the new episode was out for a bit. Well, that's me fucked for the finale. That's the first time I've not even been able to watch a task... the spider. Seriously, I'm so terrified of them it seems like the word ""arachnaphobia"" doesn't come close to describing it. I've probably seen Harry Potter & Chamber of Secrets a dozen times in my life, I've only ever listened to the Aragog scene. I'm so bad I can't even look at a cartoon spider (the original animated Hobbit movie, for instance) w/o freaking out. Or, in this case, an oversized Halloween decoration. If I was a contestant in this series, as soon as I read that on the task I would've just went ""nooooope, just give me zero points right now, I don't care, I ain't walking out of this room"" lol"
178,kev9j9_00179,Anyone know what the scores are now?
179,kev9j9_00180,The last task should of been make the best bridge in a certain time rather than fastest wins imo
180,kev9j9_00181,If only Daisy put in the effort in the prize tasks
181,kev9j9_00182,Why arent they using the chair?
182,kev9j9_00183,
183,kev9j9_00184,At what point in the final episode did you realise you had won the series?
184,kev9j9_00185,"just watched it, managed to avoid spoilers. such a tense finale... there were so many emotions on everyone's faces in that final sequences... always loved taskmaster, but that was thrill levels 100"
0,koenp0_00001,This is 10 times better than I expected! I'm sad it's only 1 episode now.
1,koenp0_00002,"""I'm sat here between brainy side and sexy side, and it's old chump in the middle"""
2,koenp0_00003,"“People are talking an awful lot of shite today, I’ll tell you that for free.”"
3,koenp0_00004,Oooooh I was in a fiiiilllmmmm
4,koenp0_00005,"I love how much fun Shirley is having, how much Greg is needling Krishnan and John, how genuinely terrible Nicola is at Arts and Crafts, and how utterly amazing a patter-merchant Rylan is. What an episode: amazing contestants, great tasks, Greg on top irascible form and a lot of funny moments."
5,koenp0_00006,"Shirley flirting SHAMELESSLY with Greg and him LOVING it is really all I want from this episode, and I'm so glad it happened in the first 4 minutes."
6,koenp0_00007,I adore Rylan's silly as balls Greg riding outfit
7,koenp0_00008,John Hannah sounds more Scottish the more annoyed he gets
8,koenp0_00009,
9,koenp0_00010,Oh my god this is fantastic. Not sure if its 10 eps of energy going into 1 episode but it feels so electric. And tbh its kinda dispelling any thoughts of needing to have people more established with eachother for good studio banter
10,koenp0_00011,I'm loving Nicola. I really wish she was in the full series.
11,koenp0_00012,"I think this special has made me realise that a good cast doesn't need to be full of comedians, throwing in people like news readers, or actors, or other likeable personalities is all you need"
12,koenp0_00013,"I hate to say it, but there's a hell of a lot more chemistry between the contestants here then there was in S10."
13,koenp0_00014,I would have loved to have seen Rylan in a whole series but I don't think his sanity would have survived by the looks of things!
14,koenp0_00015,That's a BEAUTIFUL trophy. Elegant. Modernist. Sarcastic.
15,koenp0_00016,"""you can probably get sofas through a doughnut"" Krishnan guru murphy"
16,koenp0_00017,"Good to see the proud tradition of Fabulous Clothes has been passed from Mawaan to Nicola. Hot pink frilly-skirted dress, velvet high heels, giant black bow in her hair. Fabulous. Simply fabulous."
17,koenp0_00018,Just goes to show how good a format Taskmaster is when you can put 5 people from literally anywhere on it and it still be absolutely hilarious.
18,koenp0_00019,John Hanavanning is class.
19,koenp0_00020,Shirley’s duck ‘collection’ consisting of just twelve ducks is the sort of glass-half-full energy I want to channel in 2021.
20,koenp0_00021,The tasks so far are good: not too complicated or long winded. Classic silly taskmaster.
21,koenp0_00022,"The audience sound is levelled much better here than with series 10, sounds much better. Also, they're all great contestants, this is already a great episode an we're only halfway through it"
22,koenp0_00023,I absolutely love Rylan arguing with Greg
23,koenp0_00024,Bloody hell i dont like rylan normally but i think he’s hilarious tonight.
24,koenp0_00025,I wouldn't be mad at all if these were all brought back for Season 12.
25,koenp0_00026,"I don't know why but ""You've fucked it"" or ""I've fucked it"" always seems to make me laugh when it's said with friends."
26,koenp0_00027,"""You should start a cult"" 😂"
27,koenp0_00028,I love how much the contestants are enjoying themselves so far.
28,koenp0_00029,Rylan asking the important question “But HOW do you measure the lightness”
29,koenp0_00030,Rylan is fantastic. Genius and maniac all into one. Most accurate sculpture? Get him to lie down! Genius! Then just scream all the colours on a Dulux palette at the guy! Maniac!
30,koenp0_00031,This is way better than I thought it was gonna be. Also I join the ranks of people who have a crush on Nicola
31,koenp0_00032,"John properly stitched up there, how was he not going to hit Greg?"
32,koenp0_00033,Put John Hannah in S12 or I'm going mental
33,koenp0_00034,I'm definitely excited! I know people weren't too high on Rylan being on but I think he could for sure be a lot of fun as someone who doesn't take themselves seriously
34,koenp0_00035,Did they have to fetch the cow from the hedge where Daisy left it? Great detail
35,koenp0_00036,Now I will sulk knowing that we don't get 9 more episodes of that madness. Amazing telly.
36,koenp0_00037,Rylan has had some really crafty ideas tonight 😂
37,koenp0_00038,"What a brilliant episode! I’m gutted that there isn’t a full series, they’re an amazing group. Rylan’s chaotic energy is perfect for this show, I’d love for him and Nicola to come back for a full series sometime."
38,koenp0_00039,"I was going to say it may be an unpopular opinion but, judging by this thread, I may be onto something. This one episode had more banter, more chemistry and more fun than the entirety of Season 10."
39,koenp0_00040,I’d love Rylan to be on a full series
40,koenp0_00041,Anyone else see the small writing on the back of that doughnut task. Surprised Alex didn't do one of his surprise reveals at the end
41,koenp0_00042,"Rylan is everything I want in a contestant, quick-witted, snarky and creative Please get him on a full series I beg"
42,koenp0_00043,The mental image of international ballroom champion Shirley Ballas proudly adding Greg’s golden eyebrows to her trophy collection is truly beautiful.
43,koenp0_00044,John Hannah on a whole series would be incredible.
44,koenp0_00045,Who knew Greg's fetish was ladies with drink trollies?
45,koenp0_00046,Is there anything Shirley isn't horny for.
46,koenp0_00047,Absolutely loved it - easily could’ve enjoyed a full series with this lot.
47,koenp0_00048,Why am i currently enjoying this one off with 0 comedians more than I enjoyed the average season 10 episode with 5 comedians? (I mean yes it’s very early but unless this takes a major dive)
48,koenp0_00049,Wanting to see the height difference between Nicola Coughlan and Rylan. Estimating it to be around 4 foot six inches.
49,koenp0_00050,I’m enjoying this episode a lot more than most of Season 10 Wouldn’t mind these lot being Season 12s contestants
50,koenp0_00051,"At just the first ad break I think I laughed more than any one episode of series 10. Not a knock on series 10 at all, but man, this is great. Like when Greg remarks about Shirley's rude comments in the doughnut task, he says the ""I could take it right to the rim"" and Shirley, full of innocence looks at Rylan and asks ""is that rude?"" and his face is just gold."
51,koenp0_00052,I know we've only had the prize task but I love Shirley
52,koenp0_00053,Sign me up to Rylan's cult
53,koenp0_00054,John Hannah is more of a disaster than I expected.
54,koenp0_00055,5 grams off the tower. 5 grams tower. 5G Tower. Conspiracy confirmed.
55,koenp0_00056,I didn't know what to expect but wow I'm so sad this isn't a full series now
56,koenp0_00057,Rylan has been absolutely brilliant
57,koenp0_00058,Would love Rylan on a full series!
58,koenp0_00059,Bring them back. Bring them back!
59,koenp0_00060,Krishnan Pyro-Murthy.
60,koenp0_00061,"Okay, I'm loving this cast, I especially wish we could have Shirley, Rylan and Nicola in a full series."
61,koenp0_00062,That was funnier than any S10 episode.
62,koenp0_00063,"Well that was absolutely brilliant. Laughed all the way through that. Loved all of them but especially Rylan, John and Nicola"
63,koenp0_00064,I'm already hoping this is really S12E01
64,koenp0_00065,"I'm liking this - it's a good sign. I think it's great that we can have the regular series and if this is successful, have other random shows sprinkled around."
65,koenp0_00066,Oh I really wish Rylan was in a full series
66,koenp0_00067,This is absolutely delightful. I've laughed out loud multiple times.
67,koenp0_00068,Omg Nicola being that small is too adorable.
68,koenp0_00069,Shirley taking absolutely no time to make Sally Phillips seem like a damn nun.
69,koenp0_00070,There's something on the base of that task...
70,koenp0_00071,"Honestly I’ve always thought taskmaster could be great with celebrities other than comedians. There’s lots of presenter-type celebrities that appear on plenty of panel shows could be great on taskmaster - I’m thinking the likes of Claudia Winkleman, Sandi Toksvig, Holly Willoughby, Alison Hammond, Gordon Ramsey, Gino Diacampo, Craig Revel-Horwood, Gok Wan, Susie Dent, Clare Balding, Alexander Armstrong, Richard Arnold, James May, Jonathan Ross etc etc. I think Richard Osman was a great addition to S2 and these guys have proved it to. I’d love these 5 back for a full series - especially Shirley and Rylan!"
71,koenp0_00072,Rylan's costume was fantastic 👏 👌 🙌
72,koenp0_00073,wasn't sure how this was going to be but loving this so far! everyone just seems to be really enjoying themselves
73,koenp0_00074,"Looking forward to it immensely. Will be interesting to see how well it goes branching beyond comedians / comedic actors. Side note: it’s not being aired “live” tonight, is it? Must be recorded"
74,koenp0_00075,Shirley you dirty bird! Lol
75,koenp0_00076,"This is such a good special episode! I am a bit sad they won't be in more than this one episode, but it gives me hope that the next Taskmaster season will be great as well! The last one was good, but a bit 'meh' for me sometimes."
76,koenp0_00077,Nicola was robbed.
77,koenp0_00078,
78,koenp0_00079,More energy in this single episode than most of the last series. Sorry to say it. Fab episode. I'd have loved more of this group.
79,koenp0_00080,That was actually really good! The odd cast worked and they all got into the spirit of it
80,koenp0_00081,Burning the tower to lose weight was genius
81,koenp0_00082,"There’s been writing on the back of both tasks so far, I wonder how this will come into play at the end."
82,koenp0_00083,"A question...A silly and unimportant one, mind, but a question... Are we considering this episode part of the 'canon'? Given that the contestants aren't what you'd expect for a regular Taskmaster series, and it's just a one-off? Or do people not really think/care about that?"
83,koenp0_00084,I've had a really good idea 😂
84,koenp0_00085,Just have multiple one offs with these contestants.
85,koenp0_00086,I want a full series of these contestants already!
86,koenp0_00087,Correct decision about Rylan. Well done Greg!
87,koenp0_00088,DJ Roomba!
88,koenp0_00089,"Really enjoyed that, even my brother that's an almost Taskmaster newbie enjoyed it. With the donut task, could you have put it round a tap and let water flow through it?"
89,koenp0_00090,"Oh my gosh this was so, so much funnier than I expected. I didn't expect it to be BAD, but I was in hysterics at times. I really think John and Nicola would easily fit in on a full series and I'm sad that we only get one episode of them. I didn't know Rylan and Shirley before, so I didn't know what to expect, but I liked them. The tasks were great, more of a classic Taskmaster vibe and not overly-specific. It's bittersweet to have such a great episode be a one-off, but I really don't mind them expanding the show and I'd love to see more specials with unlikely contestants. I think I'm ready to immediately watch it all over again, even though I spent the whole episode rewinding certain scenes."
90,koenp0_00091,Rylan is only 32
91,koenp0_00092,"Unsure if this is will be an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I think I would've rather seen this cast for Season 10 and the Season 10 cast for the Special. I was belly laughing for this entire episode and the cast chemistry was unreal. So cut it's only one episode :(("
92,koenp0_00093,Golden Eyebrows?!
93,koenp0_00094,"That was fun, so much chaos"
94,koenp0_00095,I just got to the part where Shirley just shook her tits at the camera for what felt like was too long and not long enough at the same time
95,koenp0_00096,Didn't realise I had a thing for John Hannah until now...
96,koenp0_00097,"Did the continuity announcer really introduce them all by their actual names, and Clare from Derry Girls?"
97,koenp0_00098,"i loved season 10 but the lacklustre studio banter in it is suddenly,,, very obvious"
98,koenp0_00099,We want more!
99,koenp0_00100,better than all of series 10 for me. so much fun.
100,koenp0_00101,Well that was great. Loved the guest cast and you could really feel the energy compared to S10.
101,koenp0_00102,"""So you have essentially come in wearing a costume that is meant to look like you're riding on my back, but really it just looks like my face is on your penis... ... and yet, gut instinct tells me this is gonna damage Krishnan's career more."""
102,koenp0_00103,"You know, I thought this was just going to be a nice-but-inconsequential little bit of fluff on New Year's Day, and it's only gone and ended up being one of the best bloody episodes ever."
103,koenp0_00104,Shirley's made a demented clown.
104,koenp0_00105,Shirley is my absolute favourite so far. These innuendos better continue! And Nicola is so adorable.
105,koenp0_00106,We'll come at you Greg because you're wrong!
106,koenp0_00107,I never expected to love Shirley as much as I did!
107,koenp0_00108,"""People are talking a lot of shite today, I'll tell you that for nothin'."""
108,koenp0_00109,Did anybody else notice there was writing on the back of the task for the doughnut task? Any ideas what it said?
109,koenp0_00110,Did anyone go to a recording for this? Don't remember seeing anything about it so can't imagine there will be any laughter added like season 10. Anyone know?
110,koenp0_00111,Greg looks 20 years younger in that photo frame hehe
111,koenp0_00112,Does anybody have a Google Drive link or something for us non-UK peeps?
112,koenp0_00113,Shirley is dirty AF and my new GILF crush.
113,koenp0_00114,"When Greg was listing the innuendo's Shirley made during the donut task, you could hear Shirley lean over to a contestant and ask ""is that rude?"" as she apparently meant nothing sexual by ""on the rim"", while Greg interpreted it as such. Thought that was kinda adorable."
114,koenp0_00115,"I genuinely wanted a full series of this cast. Especially Nicola, she was so charming. And I loved her skeleton."
115,koenp0_00116,"We have subtitles on, what does Rylan's badge say in the studio?"
116,koenp0_00117,RIP John.
117,koenp0_00118,You just know those eyebrows are going on her trophy cabinet alongside those ballroom trophies 🏆
118,koenp0_00119,I knew y'all were gonna love it!
119,koenp0_00120,
120,koenp0_00121,I see the cow is still in the hedge
121,koenp0_00122,I loath those bop-it toys.
122,koenp0_00123,Rylan's reaction there :D
123,koenp0_00124,"John was on 11, gained 4 in the live task,, lost 4 for hitting Greg and then ended on 10..."
124,koenp0_00125,Did... did Greg have sex with that lady afterwards? :P
125,koenp0_00126,"I really thought this would be a throwaway episode (I didn't know a single contestant going in to this) but this was fantastic. I definitely think this version of Taskmaster needs another episode, though."
126,koenp0_00127,I really liked the tasks in this special. Their simplicity seemed to harken back to classic TM episodes. Hoping that we’ll get some more of in Series 11
127,koenp0_00128,"American here, Will there be any way for non-British to watch it? Any recordings/drives being made?"
128,koenp0_00129,"SHIRLEY BROKE THE DOUGHNUT, HOW IS THAT NOT 0 POINTS???"
129,koenp0_00130,I can’t watch Live because I’m in the US. But I was lucky enough to see the virtual screening a few weeks back. And I’m just waiting for the one task that hasn’t happened yet. I won’t spoil anything tho
130,koenp0_00131,How has the virtual audience sounded so far? I was worried about that!
131,koenp0_00132,But why the fire???
132,koenp0_00133,"""I was thinking about... science"""
133,koenp0_00134,Is it in 480p only for anyone else
134,koenp0_00135,That was a lot of fun! I’m sort of sad we don’t get multiple episodes with this group. Could be lots of fun if they got the group back together for another special next year.
135,koenp0_00136,"New trophy, looks like a moustache but who knows?!"
136,koenp0_00137,John going for the bricks... Ahhh yes...
137,koenp0_00138,"Pretty sure Alex produced nicola name wrong. Coughlan is normally pronounced cock-lin , he pronounced it like a cough (kauf) Edit: gregg just did there too! https://twitter.com/nicolacoughlan/status/1165951611665039360?s=19"
138,koenp0_00139,Yes Shirley!
139,koenp0_00140,Channel 4 brews lol
140,koenp0_00141,The full episode was just released on YouTube: https://youtu.be/LYMaf81HxlA
141,koenp0_00142,
142,koenp0_00143,"Trying to find analogues between these contestants and past one, and I honestly cannot find one for Rylan. John had a direct approach but couldn't always pull it off, maybe like a Kerry Godliman Krishnan is clearly fun but compulsively checks himself a lot, so maybe Mark Watson Nicola is brilliant chaos that only occasionally comes off, so some combination of Jess Knappett/James Acaster/Mawaan Rizwan Shirley is Sally Phillips' chaos and horniness times 1000 But Rylan is just a pure wildcard, in the best possible way. 100% dirty bastard."
143,koenp0_00144,"Fantastic episode, agree with everybody saying this so should have been a whole series. The price task alone had better banter than the whole series 10."
144,koenp0_00145,Because it was a one off they should of had it atleast an hour and a half episode. Maybe even two hours. Very much enjoyed it though.
145,koenp0_00146,I am unsure how the kid-friendly version of this would look like!
146,koenp0_00147,This was better than the whole of series 10.
147,koenp0_00148,"Famously late to the party but I still wanted to add some thoughts: - being entertaining on Taskmaster is useless skill #3078 and I admire people who can pull it off, especially when it's not their chosen profession to be funny. - of the five contestants, Hannah was the only one I knew prior to the show as a continent-lubber. And Greg took great joy in going after him (I did get the impression that Hannahs ego got a couple of bruises, lol). If TM gains more prominence, wouldn't it be just to die for if the TM needled even bigger names for the next special? - I admire how TM manages to strike a balance between harmless fun, rather brutal put-downs and childlike glee. Kudos to the creators...."
148,koenp0_00149,John: can I break this ? Alex: I think your strong enough God Alex is quick
149,koenp0_00150,Great line up ✅ Great tasks ✅ Inventive and funny task approaches ✅ Great way to start the year ✅
150,koenp0_00151,"Slightly random question from an American. I hear some people say Greg's last name as Dave-eez and some people say Davis. I understand that both the man and the spelling are Welsh, and in Welsh it actually is pronounced like Davis. Since both are seemingly being used freely, is Dave-eez actually viewed as incorrect or simply an English vs Welsh pronunciation difference?"
151,koenp0_00152,Technically the hole in the donut spans the entire universe. That'd be my argument for 5 points.
152,koenp0_00153,Can I get this in the US?
153,koenp0_00154,"It was fun, but I worry that it's moving from being a parody of all those terrible competitive reality TV shows with minor celebrities that take themselves too seriously, to actually becoming one of those shows."
154,koenp0_00155,Did anyone catch what was written on the back of the donut task envelope?
155,koenp0_00156,Would love to see this in the US. Anyone have leads?
156,koenp0_00157,It was a great deal of fun but also I hope they'll never do another 1-off ever again. I already want more episodes from this cast and it annoys me to no end that there are none.
157,koenp0_00158,Nicola was the best. Shirley was pretty annoying and trying too hard. Rylan just looks like figurine.
158,koenp0_00159,
159,koenp0_00160,"Man, I needed the laughs from this right now. I agree with everyone else sayigg by these four should have gotten their own season. Great chemistry."
160,koenp0_00161,BRILLIANT. Loved this so much. Would love a full series of this line up.
161,koenp0_00162,Was there text behind the task in the donut task?
162,koenp0_00163,A New Year Treat indeed. That was great fun. I wasn't familiar with any of the contestants apart from seeing a series of Derry Girls and being aware of who John Hannah is. I think Shirley Ballas went straight up with my favourite contestants. I think it had a different kind of atmosphere and joviality compared to usual with it only being one show.
163,koenp0_00164,Really enjoyed the episode though I wonder if there was a reason it was only available at 480p with a weird black frame around it?
164,koenp0_00165,Really great episode!
165,koenp0_00166,7+4 is 11 not 10
166,koenp0_00167,What are the chances that they can get this cast for a full series? They were brilliant!
167,koenp0_00168,

0,n6f38g_00001,Trying to figure out who would've made the 3D models. Anyone have any idea?
1,n6f38g_00002,Charlotte's air safety presentation is absurdly adorable. Her rooting around in the overhead bin like a little forest creature. 😍
2,n6f38g_00003,None of the jelly contestants should have got points. 🤷‍♂️
3,n6f38g_00004,Could you have tilted the metronome enough somehow (maybe with a wedge of paper or something) so that it no longer functions? Was that against the rules?
4,n6f38g_00005,"Ugh, the google drive that normally has these didn’t upload the latest episode. Not sure where I can watch it."
5,n6f38g_00006,Anyone else notice the Metro train with gnome stood on it in the intro to the...ahem...'Metro-gnome' task?
6,n6f38g_00007,"""I would assume it's giving me quests"" BAHAHAHA JAMALI"
7,n6f38g_00008,Haven't seen a live task this tense since 'sausage or finger'.
8,n6f38g_00009,That’s one of the best studio tasks of the whole show. Genuinely tense!
9,n6f38g_00010,CHARLOTTE'S ACCENT IS ACTUALLY SO GOOD THOUGH HOLY FUCK
10,n6f38g_00011,Mike: “I just like being told what to do.”
11,n6f38g_00012,Of course Mike speaks German.
12,n6f38g_00013,"Last week Mike admitted he has an oral fixation, and this week he said he enjoys being subservient. All his thirsty fans are probably losing their collective minds right about now. 😂"
13,n6f38g_00014,i would pay good money to watch mike and charlotte as a detective duo
14,n6f38g_00015,The Tushy in Its Sweetest Era The memoirs of Mike Wozniak
15,n6f38g_00016,Top shithousing from Maddix as usual but my boy flew too close to the sun
16,n6f38g_00017,The french subtitles was a nice touch
17,n6f38g_00018,"“I’ve had a bit of an accident. 🥺” Charlotte, honey 😭"
18,n6f38g_00019,Clap with me! Click with me!!
19,n6f38g_00020,"That's pretty french, Hombre"
20,n6f38g_00021,"Charlotte embracing the children's TV presenter role? Blessed bee! I laughed a lot this ep. But for some dumb reason, Alex's intro for Mike got me the most: ""Who used to go by Niak. Here's Mike Was-Niak"". Goddamn, bravo!"
21,n6f38g_00022,"That's pretty French, hombre!"
22,n6f38g_00023,How the heck did Mike remember all that from GCSE German?!?
23,n6f38g_00024,I didn't think I'd see Greg breastfeed a mythical kangaroo-pigeon-hen hybrid but...here we are.
24,n6f38g_00025,"""One of them even trumped a bit of his bottom out trying to please me"" - no one has ever set such an insurmountable standard in the past seasons"
25,n6f38g_00026,"Lee's advice might sound like shit but as someone who fears flying, honestly one thing that helps me get over it is just shrugging and accepting, ""yeah, I'll die, and that's okay!"" That's the safety advice for me, lol."
26,n6f38g_00027,Did anyone else think Charlotte was going to climb into the baggage compartment?
27,n6f38g_00028,Alex telling Lee the the water was hot was low key the funniest part of the whole episode. I legit cackled at that.
28,n6f38g_00029,Sarah is lowkey the craziest person in the cast I think.
29,n6f38g_00030,"""I'd kill it, yeah"" - Mike Wozniak"
30,n6f38g_00031,"As a German, I don’t think I’ve ever laughed as much as I did during the safety announcement task. Herr Wozniak is fun personified."
31,n6f38g_00032,AAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH! DIE! I kind of love Sarah ❤️
32,n6f38g_00033,Sarah Kendalls flight announcement was my highlight of the night
33,n6f38g_00034,Loved Charlotte hiding behind her hands after yet another children's TV audition...
34,n6f38g_00035,"""do you understand the task?"" ""I am afraid I do!"""
35,n6f38g_00036,This is the task she (Charlotte) apologised about most. I'd expect nothing less.
36,n6f38g_00037,Le chat est boing boing
37,n6f38g_00038,"Lee's lucky that Mike blew out his anus, because otherwise his poppadomy-watery dribble would go down as one of the grossest moments in Taskmaster history."
38,n6f38g_00039,And Lee has absolutely lost it. Tremendous.
39,n6f38g_00040,"""I've got a BAFTA!"" - Lee Mack"
40,n6f38g_00041,"I think this was my favorite episode in years. Every single task by every single contestant had me laughing out (very) loud. So much so, that I had to constantly skip back a couple of seconds because I missed what was being said because I was laughing so hard xD Had a real sh***y day today and this was just the perfect way to make me to go to bed in a better mood :) Thanks Taskmaster! Side note: can someone explain to me why Charlotte was so embarrassed by the flight attendant task? She looked like she was on the verge breaking down in tears in the studio. They mentioned something about Lorraine Kelly, who I'm not really that familiar with, other than I think she's a Scottish TV presenter? Was there something particularly embarrassing about her impression of her?"
41,n6f38g_00042,"I knew Lee would either be completely creative / insane like Rhod or meltdown in panic, and I think his panicked yelling ""I haven't got the nerve for this show"" and ""I've got a BAFTA you know"" while hot water and poppadom crumbs fall out of his mouth just about sums up where he landed."
42,n6f38g_00043,Not read the other comments but Charlotte’s reaction to getting on a plane and then her little fist pump at the points she got at the end of that toast was so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Edit: I said toast instead of task but I kind of like it tbh
43,n6f38g_00044,Greg taking his glasses off as Sarah got ready for her final one was golden
44,n6f38g_00045,Is Sarah incoherently and quite intensely screaming while the audience laugh one of the most strangely unnerving moments on taskmaster?
45,n6f38g_00046,Mike absolutely knew what he was doing mentioning that his British creature queues.
46,n6f38g_00047,Mike was very unlucky there not to come away with the win
47,n6f38g_00048,I LOVE LOVE LOVED the moment Mike stepped up for the studio task & Greg greeted him like an old foe. the familiarity! the chemistry! it was like Sherlock & Moriarty but best friends! also: great that they started on satisfyingly wobbly things & ended on satisfyingly wobbly contestants ~
48,n6f38g_00049,Pretty sure 'Big Time Chat Fuel Time' is getting added to the Clock of Wozniak.
49,n6f38g_00050,That was one of the funniest starts to an episode
50,n6f38g_00051,"I'm German and that was the funniest shit, he spoke quite well actually!"
51,n6f38g_00052,It's getting heartbreaking to see Charlotte's confidence evaporate every week. It looked like she wanted to disappear from the stage after the aeroplane task.
52,n6f38g_00053,"I love Lee on Taskmaster so much. Like, the collective way this sub loses their mind about Mike every week? That's how I am about Lee. His story about his tummy and his hysterical ""I've won a BAFTA"" have really sealed the deal and made him my favorite ever Taskmaster contestant."
53,n6f38g_00054,"Sarah's is one of the funniest, cleverest things I've ever seen on Taskmaster"
54,n6f38g_00055,Will Charlotte ever cease to become lovelier and lovelier every week?
55,n6f38g_00056,I must admit I wasn’t expecting to see Greg pretend to breastfeed an imaginary endangered species today
56,n6f38g_00057,"Jamali is still a goddamn genius. Of course, I'm biased, as I immediately thought of the phone thing myself once I heard the task, as well as considered ways to stablise oneself during the live task - but still, I'm just consistently amazed by how good he is. And Charlotte keeps being adorable. Loved the moment when she got on a plane, her prize (oof) and her face when Alex ""miscounted"" the score tallies."
57,n6f38g_00058,Only GCSE Germany?! Seemed very advanced and well put together
58,n6f38g_00059,I love this show so much. I've had a rough couple of weeks emotionally but I was grinning like an idiot the whole episode.
59,n6f38g_00060,Mike just looked at Alex like ‘it’s all gone Daddy!’ when holding the empty plate.
60,n6f38g_00061,"German speaker here, Mike has definitely learned German beyond GCSE or he had access to a big dictionary because he knew a lot of pretty impressive vocab and his German was pretty good. He made a few mistakes but overall I was impressed"
61,n6f38g_00062,So Charlotte gets the same amount of points for doing two tasks that sarah got for doing none of them?
62,n6f38g_00063,Not a bad accent from Ritchie
63,n6f38g_00064,"Ah, my favourite low-cost travel solution, Fjnfleijfnclejfoinjlviflnafmjlfcfmjmc;ewfcjwnmfchnwm Airways."
64,n6f38g_00065,How can a grown woman shoving poppadoms into her mouth be so adorable? I thought I couldn't love Charlotte more than I already did but she repeatedly proves me wrong in every episode.
65,n6f38g_00066,I just want to give Charlotte a nice big hug.
66,n6f38g_00067,"I know it isn't actually anything, but Lee sitting down in the plane was one of the funniest things."
67,n6f38g_00068,LEAVING MIKE TILL LAST...
68,n6f38g_00069,"Mikes left until last. I am half afraid, half excited. What has the man done!?"
69,n6f38g_00070,"""Eek!"" - Charlotte Ritchie ""Good grief."" - Mike Wozniak"
70,n6f38g_00071,Greatest final task of the show since horse or laminator.
71,n6f38g_00072,Charlotte was transcendent in this episode
72,n6f38g_00073,"At this point, I'm here for everything Mike and Charlotte. Everyone else is just a bonus. Another classic episode, and the studio task was one of my favorites. This show works better than any antidepressant I've ever taken."
73,n6f38g_00074,"Mike’s pronunciation of the word tooth has come the closest to killing my attraction to him, even more than the haemorrhoid."
74,n6f38g_00075,Best episode yet I think! It felt more cohesive and great vibing off each other.
75,n6f38g_00076,"Mike randomly waltzing out of the frame, majestic as always."
76,n6f38g_00077,"Charlotte's ""I've had an accident"" shouldve been the episode title so im waiting to see how 'An Orderly Species"" comes into it"
77,n6f38g_00078,Mike's wobbly at the best of times
78,n6f38g_00079,Sarah's aircraft announcement!!!!!! DED!!!
79,n6f38g_00080,JAMALI SHITHOUSERY A++++
80,n6f38g_00081,That was brilliant from Mike. German is the perfect language for him
81,n6f38g_00082,Still waiting for metronome to sound like a word again
82,n6f38g_00083,"Is that a guaranteed Upper Second if I say ""hair is different to head, that's why there's two different words"" during my linguistics exam about semantics?"
83,n6f38g_00084,"Me and jamali are on the same wavelength, I had the phone idea for the metronome and the elbow idea for the final task"
84,n6f38g_00085,I can't wait to see Jamali shithouse this
85,n6f38g_00086,"""Kendall has been such a player in this game"" ""The tried and tested"" Love how seriously Greg was taking that one!"
86,n6f38g_00087,"""I'm so sorry...everyone."" Charlotte Ritchie is me when I fart in public"
87,n6f38g_00088,"""Well it's sticking now so I might as well embrace it"" I don't think I've ever fallen in love with a human being so fast as this series of Taskmaster."
88,n6f38g_00089,"Oh Mike, how I love you and your tushy in it's sweetest era"
89,n6f38g_00090,"The hardest i've laughed during a prize task since the laminator incident. All those jellies!! Also, the banter section was priceless, I'm so curious to know what Alex was originally going to do with that bit before Greg intervened."
90,n6f38g_00091,"Lee's pantomiming during the air flight safety task had me dying. Spliced in with Jamali's uh...let's say ""limited"" French elevated that task so much. It's an all-time task."
91,n6f38g_00092,Keeping my fingers crossed for that Mike comeback. 9 points isn't that much of a lead!
92,n6f38g_00093,Gregg breastfeeding the monstrosity is the highlight so far this season 🤣😂😂😂
93,n6f38g_00094,lowkey wish they made them wear flight attendants outfits
94,n6f38g_00095,This genuinely might end up being my favorite series ever.
95,n6f38g_00096,I saw this episode in the audience and had clearly blocked out lee spitting out watery poppadom
96,n6f38g_00097,Record yourself saying Metronome and play om repeat Jamali heard me
97,n6f38g_00098,Hope they sell the little creature models
98,n6f38g_00099,"Bien, homme."
99,n6f38g_00100,"Classic Greg, breastfeeding the creature. Moments like that are why I love him."
100,n6f38g_00101,Jamali has basically made a french art house film in this one
101,n6f38g_00102,"If they ever reboot the universe, I'm all for Mike Wozniak being in charge of animal logistics."
102,n6f38g_00103,Charlotte's air hostess voice is lovely! Sarah's....errrr not so much....
103,n6f38g_00104,"""Tushy in its sweetest era""."
104,n6f38g_00105,"Another incredible episode! Every task was flawless. I particularly enjoyed the exquisite corpse task, since that used to be something I was really into. I really hope they do make the British creatures available in the Taskmaster store, as Alex seemed to intimate is a possibility in one of his tweets tonight."
105,n6f38g_00106,Well Sarah has lost it
106,n6f38g_00107,"Again, another solid episode. I'm actually happy to know Mike actually has a chance to win this series!!!! two episodes left, I am holding my breath..."
107,n6f38g_00108,"We're getting 5 jellies, aren't we?"
108,n6f38g_00109,I love how Greg is taking a shine to jamali
109,n6f38g_00110,Oh poor Charlotte looked devastated
110,n6f38g_00111,"Next time I fly, if I ever do, I want Mike to do the safety announcement"
111,n6f38g_00112,
112,n6f38g_00113,My eyes! The breastfeeding!
113,n6f38g_00114,I want those 3D models! Hopefully they add them to the shop - they would be a cool piece of merchandise.
114,n6f38g_00115,Two weeks later and they still won't let us forget the incident.
115,n6f38g_00116,"""ok....let's dance!"" Is so 80s action movie and I am here for it!"
116,n6f38g_00117,Loved it that we could also participate in the guessing
117,n6f38g_00118,"Something I’d love in this sub would be an episode recap with the current scores everyone is on. It’s tough to track sometimes. If I’ve done the maths right, Lee is catching on Sarah with a 7 point difference between them"
118,n6f38g_00119,I really like comparing Mike and Jamali's intelligence. Mike seems book smart but Jamali is capable of some really quick thinking!
119,n6f38g_00120,"Good episode. I did feel like the points were a bit random though. The exquisite corpse task understandably so, but the ""Plane Announcer"" task seemed weird. Wasn't the goal mostly centered around the accent and being ""memorable""? But then Greg judged it as who would be the most calming. Obviously not a huge deal, it's just a fun tv program, but it kind of felt like awarding the opposite of the task. Love Mike, but I wouldn't call his more 'memorable' than Lees or Sarah's. Also, was it a rule that you couldn't just immediately stop the metronome?"
120,n6f38g_00121,"""I started wanging it in the lounge"""
121,n6f38g_00122,“I’ve had a bit of an accident” i love her
122,n6f38g_00123,"""Yeah, I'm in a plane!"""
123,n6f38g_00124,I'd love to see Mike's tushy in its sweetest era.
124,n6f38g_00125,This was honestly one of the most fun price tasks they had in a long time...probably since series 7 with the box and James Acaster being taken to the back.
125,n6f38g_00126,"""I've had a bit of an accident"" - Charlotte Ritchie"
126,n6f38g_00127,Half expecting Charlotte to just say BADENGDEH
127,n6f38g_00128,Anyone else feel Greg has been generous with Jamali’s points this series?
128,n6f38g_00129,
129,n6f38g_00130,I genuinely thought Lee was going to bring in his daughter as a prize task
130,n6f38g_00131,"""Posh eggs!!!"""
131,n6f38g_00132,Of course the Aussie drew kangaroo legs
132,n6f38g_00133,What an episode! What a season!
133,n6f38g_00134,
134,n6f38g_00135,Dangerous move from Woz there
135,n6f38g_00136,Pop
136,n6f38g_00137,Watching Lee and Sarah lose their minds is what I watch this show for.
137,n6f38g_00138,I think that Jamali and Greg will be best friends by the end of this show :P
138,n6f38g_00139,"I love that they have the plane, really cool for tasks"
139,n6f38g_00140,"Is Charlotte actually from the Dandy? ""Eek"""
140,n6f38g_00141,Lee’s approach to safety announcements and the inevitability of death is very zen
141,n6f38g_00142,"Hmm... No one said you couldn't crouch entirely behind the curtain, did they?"
142,n6f38g_00143,The separation of North and South Korea disco dance is a thing of beauty. Lol
143,n6f38g_00144,A MILK TUFF
144,n6f38g_00145,"Can someone with a 3D printer, print the animal drawings? Would really like a copy of them"
145,n6f38g_00146,One Or Two Legs completes the epic trilogy begun by Sausage Or Finger and Horse Or Laminator.
146,n6f38g_00147,I love it when Alex starts laughing at his own jokes. Makes him seem human.
147,n6f38g_00148,Woz closing the gap!
148,n6f38g_00149,YANKEN SIE
149,n6f38g_00150,"""I've had a bit of an accident"""
150,n6f38g_00151,They're all actually really good drawers. Love Charlotte's pigeon face
151,n6f38g_00152,Jamali has worked out how to play Greg’s game.
152,n6f38g_00153,I thought last week's episode was the best of the series....but this one....terrific so far!
153,n6f38g_00154,This is such a stupid live task. I love it
154,n6f38g_00155,Does anyone know who is on Sarah's T-Shirt?
155,n6f38g_00156,Surely the most obvious British animal is a bulldog? WHY DID NO ONE THINK OF THIS?
156,n6f38g_00157,I love Mike There you go.
157,n6f38g_00158,Quite possibly the most well rounded jam packed opening 15 mins of TM I remember watching. What a start 😂
158,n6f38g_00159,Mike by himself again...
159,n6f38g_00160,MIKE!! You didn't let us down!
160,n6f38g_00161,
161,n6f38g_00162,Poor Mike!
162,n6f38g_00163,Jamali bringing the street smart to the show again.
163,n6f38g_00164,"Think it might be Mike’s comeback, lads!"
164,n6f38g_00165,"This is tough task to judge, it’s based solely off the announcement and not the demonstration"
165,n6f38g_00166,Lee is loving this
166,n6f38g_00167,"Unlike the Line of Duty series finale, I know that my weekly fix of TM will never disappoint"
167,n6f38g_00168,Lee has officially lost it
168,n6f38g_00169,That does look very British somehow
169,n6f38g_00170,"Greg is really biased towards the team of two, can't remember if team of three ever won one yet"

172,n6f38g_00173,Well played Sarah
173,n6f38g_00174,"I'm kinda disappointed in the prize task, I was hoping for some creative wobbly things. My first thought was a 'wobbly pop""."
174,n6f38g_00175,"Tick tock, it's Taskmaster o'clock"
175,n6f38g_00176,This will be Sarah's bad episode and it'll spice up the final two episodes
176,n6f38g_00177,Have they all brought jelly in? Fuck me 😂
177,n6f38g_00178,"It's not very often that Taskmaster literally makes me gag but eugh Lee, poppadoms, no. I can't."
178,n6f38g_00179,Mike is smashing this one. Are we at the point in his narrative where he starts to get his mojo back?
179,n6f38g_00180,Ohh this is like that old game with the folded paper were people draw a section each....usually fun :)
180,n6f38g_00181,What a fantastic idea for a task
181,n6f38g_00182,Greg said the episode title
182,n6f38g_00183,Prime chat fuel.
183,n6f38g_00184,That was some blissful chaos.
184,n6f38g_00185,"Mash up the poppadom, put it in water, drink it"
185,n6f38g_00186,"What is it with Mike Wozniak making strange noises, whether it be from his mouth or his arse?"
186,n6f38g_00187,Pop!
187,n6f38g_00188,Thought of King crimson as soon as I saw Lee and Mike's 2 headed animal.
188,n6f38g_00189,Buy less! Buy our jeans
189,n6f38g_00190,"What's wrong with bobble heads or is that not a thing with kids and comedians these days in the UK? Is there something wrong with my brain that those were the first things I thought of when asked to bring in the most 'wobbly thing'? (For the record: I'm Dutch, not American)."
190,n6f38g_00191,Fuck. Maddix has hacked it
191,n6f38g_00192,I REALLY hope everyone's brought in jelly
192,n6f38g_00193,Lee’s going to have nightmares about Taskmaster
193,n6f38g_00194,This is just picture Consequences. We used to play this at my grandparents'.
194,n6f38g_00195,"Did it ever say you couldn't mess with the metronome? If not, I would have slowed it down or stopped it tbh."
195,n6f38g_00196,"'3 episodes to go. its squeaky bum time'. Yeah I get it, channel 4 announcer."
196,n6f38g_00197,Metronome...metronome... metronome
197,n6f38g_00198,Metromomomom
198,n6f38g_00199,"My first thought for wobbly thing would be to bring in some Weebles, but get them customized to look like Greg and Alex"

200,n6f38g_00201,Metromoan?
201,n6f38g_00202,Anyone know where Charlotte's shirt is from?

216,n6f38g_00217,"Episode 8 Little late to the party this week, hard avoiding spoilers from friends Prize task - wobbly winner Jamali - still just a jelly Lee - still just a jelly Charlotte - still just a jelly Mike - wobbling baby tuths were satisfying Sarah - don’t see it being too wobbly Task one - mesmerising metronome Don’t think Greg’s being fair they’re he did laugh didn’t he? Hoped the subtitler would’ve gone along with the joke there... Shit myself with lees haha Well that was gross Recording it wouldn’t count in my book Team task two - adjoined animal I probably go with either a sheep or a fox This is going to be a glorious mess Greg breastfeeding got spoiled for me and I’m gutted, would’ve been so much funnier if I didn’t know it was coming, still funny though Mikes better at bullshitting than I remember, those creatures are really well made, wonder who made them Task three This is where lee shines You really can’t deny the kids tv presenter thing after that Don’t know what accent or language that was but it was definitely unforgettable Sarah’s lead is disappearing Stage task Are we going to have a repeat of jo brand? Hope so Fun task and great episode"

Taskmaster Island was great, the yogurt tower task was high drama, the 4 photo task was creative and hilarious, and the fish task ended on such a clincher. I say this every week, but this is one of those few shows that consistently cheers me up after a heavy day. This is just me musing on, but every time I watch an episode of Taskmaster, I wonder what it must be like to share these laughs with someone else. I've watched all 11 series by myself. Feels like such a waste of great potential bonding moments with a loved one. Oh well."

34,nbp1oi_00035,Jamali destroying everything is giving me the vibes of when Alex had to buy a second toy because Liza Tarbuck stepped on the first one.
35,nbp1oi_00036,No ones asked Mike to throw in catchphrases for his characters like “Spaceman! Into the unknown!” But I’m loving it
36,nbp1oi_00037,"That was an emotional rollercoaster. I'm stuck between desperately wanting Mike to ace the yogurt task and loving how delightful his failure was. So proud of Charlotte. I'm ok with Sarah winning now. At first I was worried it would be a total blowout but everybody's gotten to win at least one episode and the drama of the live task has been high every time! I'm gonna miss this cast more than any other I think. Also, Mike's faces in the background in the fish task. what the fuck lmao"
37,nbp1oi_00038,"Between ""Michael"" and ""Rhodri"", Greg calling people by their full names really does it for me for whatever reason, haha."
38,nbp1oi_00039,Greg's favouritism for Jamali is showing.
39,nbp1oi_00040,Happy Charlotte won so she has a frog jumper to match her frog shirt 🐸
40,nbp1oi_00041,"If Charlotte gets to be the children's TV host in our imaginations, I think it's only fair to include Mike as the host in the sub-segments about science stuff. He'd pull it off well."
41,nbp1oi_00042,"I can't believe Charlotte got away with saying ""bonk"" when she took away the task from the bottle in the first task. I guess there's only so many times Greg can give out about the children's TV."
42,nbp1oi_00043,The camera task was so fun. One of my favourites of the season. Lee deserved better on that one
43,nbp1oi_00044,Mike's face in the background 😂
44,nbp1oi_00045,"So atm sarah is only ahead by like 5 points, right? How funny would it be if Mike wins by 1 point and him sharting himsrlf on national tv is what wins him the series"
45,nbp1oi_00046,Lee did all of that Jamali took his glasses off.
46,nbp1oi_00047,"Greg's love for ""narratives"" is fascinating. He was suddenly very interested as soon as Sarah mentioned a story for her pictures."
47,nbp1oi_00048,"""falls off the Knappett"", poor Jess"
48,nbp1oi_00049,GET YOURSELF TO A SAFE SPACE!!!
49,nbp1oi_00050,Sarah's second picture: hair
50,nbp1oi_00051,My god the yogurt task was one of the best I’ve ever seen in terms of them ragging on Alex. When Sarah called him a little bitch I about spit my drink out.
51,nbp1oi_00052,"Calling it one ep before the final: this is the best season of Taskmaster, bar none. Every contestant brings something to the table, and the tasks are peak form . No filler, all killer."
52,nbp1oi_00053,“The knappett”
53,nbp1oi_00054,Sarah has fucking lost it this episode. It's brilliant
54,nbp1oi_00055,"I would've bet money that Sarah was well acquainted with power tools. The episode title should definitely have been ""Backup Rainbow""."
55,nbp1oi_00056,Another new spin off show coming from this year’s cast “Yoghurt or poo?” With Sarah Kendall
56,nbp1oi_00057,'I have a very narrow view about what you people do' Ahahahahahahaha
57,nbp1oi_00058,Lee only getting 3? What the fuck?!?!?!?!?
58,nbp1oi_00059,“I’m really suggestible when it comes to you young man”
59,nbp1oi_00060,It’s so in character for Jamali to whip out a blow torch.
60,nbp1oi_00061,Probably the most bullying Alex had to experience in one task.
61,nbp1oi_00062,"did anyone think Jamali might have actually been a little displeased with how he had to do the yoghurt task while it was raining, they edited out Alex's reaction to him in the studio it seemed"
62,nbp1oi_00063,Tick tock it's meow o'clock
63,nbp1oi_00064,"""I like Jamali"" You and me both, Lee"
64,nbp1oi_00065,An indication of a convincing victory is that your score is so high going into the last round that nobody can beat you. And I though Charlotte's previous win was the nuts.
65,nbp1oi_00066,"The team of three, especially Jamali, having it out for Alex has been very fun to watch the past few weeks"
66,nbp1oi_00067,Jamali is cosplaying as Katy Wix in the first one.
67,nbp1oi_00068,MIKE'S BACKGROUND FACE
68,nbp1oi_00069,who in health and safety keeps clearing jamali and what the hell ARENT they letting him do?!
69,nbp1oi_00070,Lee was robbed
70,nbp1oi_00071,I really hope they'll give them a music task next episode. Would be such a shame not to have one in a series where there are actually people who could do a great job with it.
71,nbp1oi_00072,"Lee absolutely robbed, deserved 5"
72,nbp1oi_00073,"Sarah will have to absolutely shit the bed next week for her to even come close to losing her lead. Mike is 9 points behind her, he can win if he has a perfect episode and she scores between 1 and 2 every task. It's gonna be close I hope I'm nervous for him, I was nervous for Richard last series as well"
73,nbp1oi_00074,"I want Fish Curling to be a new sport at the Winter Olympics, make it happen, IOC."
74,nbp1oi_00075,Goodness this series’ quality has been SOO consistent from week to week only episode 3 disappointed me a bit
75,nbp1oi_00076,Sarah Koi-ndall?
76,nbp1oi_00077,They should have gone for Sarah Kend-eel
77,nbp1oi_00078,The photo task was one of my favourites of all time. Every contestant had at least one that totally cracked me up. I want to try it with my family.
78,nbp1oi_00079,Alex IS a punk ass/little/hairy bitch. Very fun episode :)
79,nbp1oi_00080,"For the tower/yogurt task - I'm really surprised no one thought to make a rather small tower and essentially just punch/shove the yogurt forward off of it. The idea of trying to keep it stability poised on top just seems so impossible. Still definitely fun to watch - does seem like less of a emphasis on ""lateral thinking"" type solutions lately, but oh well."
80,nbp1oi_00081,The picture of Lee Mack as Lady Godiva is cursed and nightmarish
81,nbp1oi_00082,"Did I mishear or in the live task, did Alex call the runway the 'knappett'? 😂😂 Also yay for the return of fish puns!"
82,nbp1oi_00083,"""Hairy little bitch"" and ""Punk ass bitch"". Lol"
83,nbp1oi_00084,"Charlotte winning another episode is a madness, fair play"
84,nbp1oi_00085,Jamali Hadix?
85,nbp1oi_00086,"""No fish puns about Sarah Kendall""? smh she's obviously a Sarah-cuda"
86,nbp1oi_00087,Greg's throwaway to the ad break regarding the fun little game of providing your partner with five reasons as to why they should stay was unreal.
87,nbp1oi_00088,"I love Mike, but his decision to use the ladder as the base for a bigger tower is among the worst decisions ever made on Taskmaster. Truly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Saying that, I don't know why, but I laughed so hard at his forceful, ""Into the future!"" during the photo task."
88,nbp1oi_00089,Mike is the only one who hasn't expressed hatred of Alex so far
89,nbp1oi_00090,"They will not let us forget! I can only wonder what reference they will make to Mike breaking wind next week. Also, shame about the tower task for Lee and Mike. They built such tall towers (Mike finding a ladder that could have been useful), but as the others found out, the yogurt won't follow your tower perfectly, only they found out much more harshly."
90,nbp1oi_00091,
91,nbp1oi_00092,"Feel like the weather task was one of the worst kinds of tasks, just very little room for them to be creative, most attempts ended up looking the same with slight variation. On the other hand Yogurt tower was great, Lee making the highest tower and then just completely missing was perfect."
92,nbp1oi_00093,"""I'm very suggestable when it comes to you, young man."" ...Yes, Greg. We know."
93,nbp1oi_00094,"""All right dad"" JAMALI LMFAOOO"
94,nbp1oi_00095,Sarah Kendolphin
95,nbp1oi_00096,
96,nbp1oi_00097,"I’m so glad they got the moving fish, the final round was fantastically dramatic"
97,nbp1oi_00098,Meow!
98,nbp1oi_00099,"Welcome to the new game show, Is It Yoghurt -or- Is It Poo?"
99,nbp1oi_00100,Just thought of a potential loophole for the tower task. Ask Alex for some chalk. Expand the score board with squares closer to the starting box. Put in absurdly high numbers. Build short tower and knock over for an easy win.
100,nbp1oi_00101,The Eccentric English Robot and Angry Northern Farmer. Love that band.
101,nbp1oi_00102,Charlotte even collects her prizes like a childrens show presenter
102,nbp1oi_00103,"So I think we can pretty much all agree that bar something disastrous happening next week, Sarah's almost certainly the series champion, right? She's about nine points ahead of Mike at this point."
103,nbp1oi_00104,"ANOTHER VICTORY FOR BEAN! Almost a grand slam for the recorded tasks, so proud! This has been my favourite series so far, im so sad its ending new week. Also, got two new guests for the tv show!"
104,nbp1oi_00105,BACKUP RAINBOW
105,nbp1oi_00106,Did anyone else notice the way alex greets lee in the yogurt task? I think he may be doing something similar to the fish puns he did with sally phillips
106,nbp1oi_00107,
107,nbp1oi_00108,Calling it rn that Woz botches this somehow.
108,nbp1oi_00109,jamali haddocks
109,nbp1oi_00110,"Yogurt and height seem to be two frequent Taskmaster bedfellows, although that’s probably because it creates such a noticeable splat that’s not particularly messy or prone to run all over the place. Lee’s attempt had me gutted! Such are the fickle winds of fate…or whatever light breeze decided to veer things off course that day lol"
110,nbp1oi_00111,PUNKASS BITCH ALEX
111,nbp1oi_00112,That might have cost Mike the series
112,nbp1oi_00113,"Mike explaining why he said 'oplar!' when the yogurt fell off his tower (""It's just what came out at the time"") might as well just be his description of his entire taskmaster experience."
113,nbp1oi_00114,Ace callback to the Knappett there
114,nbp1oi_00115,"I don't know if anybody will know what I mean, but Lee's photo with the two melons reminded me of Craig Ferguson's description of old raunchy British comedies with cheap innuendos consisting of ladies carrying melons"
115,nbp1oi_00116,Mike was born to compete in fish curling.
116,nbp1oi_00117,"I feel Mr Octopus must be a reference to Mike Wozniak, because the instant I saw that man run, I realised he was in fact two octopuses stuffed into a secondhand suit."
117,nbp1oi_00118,I'm shocked Jamali hasn't stamped on it yet
118,nbp1oi_00119,Lee's final picture is perfection.
119,nbp1oi_00120,2 for jamali is mad
120,nbp1oi_00121,"Alex has stopped giving the overall series score, anyone know what it is?"
121,nbp1oi_00122,I love how Jamali's natural instinct is just to destroy stuff
122,nbp1oi_00123,Yogurt or poo sounds like a live task in a few seasons when Alex loses his mind
123,nbp1oi_00124,"Yet another incredible episode. The last three, in particular, have been perfect, IMHO."
124,nbp1oi_00125,It's Charlotte time
125,nbp1oi_00126,"You can't spell Yoplait without ""opla""!"
126,nbp1oi_00127,Charlotte is dominating this episode
127,nbp1oi_00128,Charlotte('s fish) did a Knappett
128,nbp1oi_00129,"I don't get why people think Lee should've gotten 5 points for the camera task. His outfits weren't that varied. And I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I'm just genuinely confused because people are talking about the effort he put in, but in most of them he's basically in his shirt and shorts + bits of his Evel Knievel outfit. Then in the last he dresses up as a woman which while I appreciate the effort with the cow, is also exactly what you'd expect a middle-aged British comedian to do in this task. Lining him up with Sarah seems about right since she also dressed pretty much the same but had different characters."
129,nbp1oi_00130,Was that definitely fog that Lee Mack created? Looked more like mist to me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJC0eZEroU
130,nbp1oi_00131,"""WHOOO!"" - Charlotte Ritchie when she gets to use her DRILL"
131,nbp1oi_00132,"Lee what the fuck, lmao"
132,nbp1oi_00133,"Amazing episode, gutted the series is nearly over, everyone in it is hilarious"
133,nbp1oi_00134,Absolutely loved this episode. Had a crap week but everyone on the show made me laugh so much.
134,nbp1oi_00135,Alex trying not to laugh as Lee goes down the ladder
135,nbp1oi_00136,"Charlotte so close to a perfect game this episode, she deserved 5 points for Mr Octopus"
136,nbp1oi_00137,If he doesn't get called Jamali Haddock I riot
137,nbp1oi_00138,Was the yoghurt tower the longest task in taskmaster history? Felt like it was more than half the episode!
138,nbp1oi_00139,Sarah's genuine aggression. We love to see it
139,nbp1oi_00140,Omg Lee's last picture Ahahahahahaha
140,nbp1oi_00141,"""It's sewn into the skin?"" Jesus Christ with those morbidly grotesque knitwear the show got dark like bam"
141,nbp1oi_00142,Sarah's fish name: Barrahcundall
142,nbp1oi_00143,"I don't know what natty means, lol, so I can't judge this."
143,nbp1oi_00144,BACKUP RAINBOW 🌈
144,nbp1oi_00145,"""Back up rainbow"". God bless, Wozniak."
145,nbp1oi_00146,MIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING
146,nbp1oi_00147,MEOW
147,nbp1oi_00148,"Just watched the youtube and came here to gush over Little Alex Horne's birthday easter egg on the show, see who else noticed it ^^"
148,nbp1oi_00149,"When Lee covers half of his face in red lipstick, I can't help but to think of Noel on NMTB ""I'm coming as mummy!"" I low-key hope it's the same character in different stages of her life."
149,nbp1oi_00150,"You can topple a tower by kicking it right? My approach would have been to put the yogurt on a small tee-like tower, and just boot it towards the number grid"
150,nbp1oi_00151,Greg taking a shine to Jamali is my favourite thing
151,nbp1oi_00152,Charlotte's was awesome! Loved the look of the lightning!
152,nbp1oi_00153,Surely Lee has won this task
153,nbp1oi_00154,"So were those Alex Horne's kids in Lee's natty knitwear? They certainly had Alex's gap between the front teeth, which Lee's kids don't seem to have."
154,nbp1oi_00155,Alex is such a strange bloke I love him
155,nbp1oi_00156,IT HIT HIS HEAD LMAOOO
156,nbp1oi_00157,Jamali's rocks killed me.
157,nbp1oi_00158,Mike trying to refract light.
158,nbp1oi_00159,Is there something in the podium? It has hinges
159,nbp1oi_00160,"""is it yoghurt or is it poo?"" Eats it regardless..."
160,nbp1oi_00161,Meow.
161,nbp1oi_00162,I like Rich Man Jamali and White Man Jamali.
162,nbp1oi_00163,Proper banger of a task this one
163,nbp1oi_00164,Heart breaking last second defeat for Sarah there. What a sport
164,nbp1oi_00165,Kendall fish cake surely
165,nbp1oi_00166,Back up rainbow!!
166,nbp1oi_00167,"I want a Taskmaster Island Play Kit of my very own, perhaps made by Lego or Playmobil, please and thank you."
167,nbp1oi_00168,"NO CHARLOTTE, THAT IS NOT HOW ""BOSH"" WORKS."
168,nbp1oi_00169,"Hilarious of Sarah to say ""You shouldn't take 5 hours for a 3 hour chopping task"" when the actual quote by Lincoln is 4 hours of sharpening with a limit of 6."
169,nbp1oi_00170,I literally love this photo task. Omg.
170,nbp1oi_00171,Probably the best montage ever
171,nbp1oi_00172,Penultimate episode?!?! Where has the time gone?!
172,nbp1oi_00173,They referenced his Lord title!
173,nbp1oi_00174,Jamali's not really an internet man
174,nbp1oi_00175,Alex Horne's date of birth on the big cheque.
175,nbp1oi_00176,The gap between Sarah and Mike just closed a little bit. I may be fixating on this over these last two shows.
176,nbp1oi_00177,mike and his rainbow has big Paul in the phonebox energy
177,nbp1oi_00178,"THIS IS CHARLOTTES COME BACK. I mean it’s far to late, but I’m happy for her."
178,nbp1oi_00179,2 tasks in and Charlotte's already got more points than she does most episodes. Chuffed for her!
179,nbp1oi_00180,"""phooo! SLPAT!"""
180,nbp1oi_00181,Greg is just an older Jamali cmv
181,nbp1oi_00182,Gravity is a harsh mistress when it comes to cardboard tower constructions and the trajectory of yogurt pots.
182,nbp1oi_00183,"Oh Mike... Mike, Mike, Mike.... Lol"
183,nbp1oi_00184,Sarah getting 4 points and Mike and Lee getting none might be things squared away for the season.
184,nbp1oi_00185,MEOW
185,nbp1oi_00186,ding ding ding! Its a greg quote today!
186,nbp1oi_00187,Charlotte overcooked that fish just a little
187,nbp1oi_00188,"She’s buggered that totally haha, but she’s 6 points ahead and thus, not catchable I do believe. Wasn’t expecting two victories for Charlotte"
188,nbp1oi_00189,"The weather task may be the most disappointed I've ever been with taskmaster. The director/producers could not decide what they wanted or as has been the case in the past, where smart contestants play a role in directing the shot, the contestants did not consider it either. What I am talking about specifically is they could not decided between shooting the island as a real place (think stop motion animation) or showing it as a task where the goal was to make the contestants look funny. edit - -Wow, this has been quite a controversial comment. One of the things I have always loved about taskmaster is the production. The artistic choices of the behind the scenes people and/or the assistance they give to the contestants in this regard. Where they (the production and contestants) fell down in the task I can't know, but it seems to me the task directions should have led to a differently filmed result. It specifically said ""realistic."" Giants dumping water through a colander the size of a hill or wielding a blower the size of a multi story building is not realistic to me."
189,nbp1oi_00190,HERE FOR JAMALI SHITHOUSERY
190,nbp1oi_00191,Jamali just wants to fuck it up.
191,nbp1oi_00192,This is charlottes episode!!!!
192,nbp1oi_00193,"You absolute bastard, Horne"
193,nbp1oi_00194,Oh Mike :\
194,nbp1oi_00195,Pike Wozniak
195,nbp1oi_00196,"""It's weird, Alex."""
196,nbp1oi_00197,"""Honestly, I didn't know what 'natty' meant"" - Jamali Maddix"
197,nbp1oi_00198,"In the entirely impossible scenario Greg is no longer Taskmaster, Jamali would be a possibility"
198,nbp1oi_00199,"""This is Greta Thunberg's nightmare"""
199,nbp1oi_00200,Who gave that man a blowtorch?!
200,nbp1oi_00201,"Is the wind part of the task? Oh, Charlotte. Loll"
201,nbp1oi_00202,This is one of those tasks which is probably harder than it looks
202,nbp1oi_00203,Mike!
203,nbp1oi_00204,That was BRILLIANT
204,nbp1oi_00205,My queen Charlotte playing a perfect episode so far <3
205,nbp1oi_00206,Completely off topic but that adverts got me thinking How much of a hit do you reckon Corona's sales have taken from the last year or so
206,nbp1oi_00207,A perfectly normal game of fish shuffleboard
207,nbp1oi_00208,FISHY DRAMA
208,nbp1oi_00209,"Tick tock, its task time."
209,nbp1oi_00210,YEAH A BLIZZARD
210,nbp1oi_00211,I predict this is Charlottes episode!
211,nbp1oi_00212,"""If you give me four hours to chop down a tree im gonna spend three hours sharpening the blade"""
212,nbp1oi_00213,"Yes Mike, YES!"
213,nbp1oi_00214,charlotte is smashing it this episode!!
214,nbp1oi_00215,I will have nightmares of Lee there
215,nbp1oi_00216,Heartbreaking
216,nbp1oi_00217,"Also, Saury Kendall. Best I can think of."
217,nbp1oi_00218,"I loved the music at the beginning of the camera task, very ‘dance of the knights’."
218,nbp1oi_00219,"I really want some of those fish for my classroom, I like to steal the not so outrageously complex tasks to do on a Friday afternoon"
219,nbp1oi_00220,"""Yes or no answers only. Excited?"" ""Sure."""
220,nbp1oi_00221,Penultimate episode? I’m not ready to say goodbye to Charlotte yet.
221,nbp1oi_00222,Mike is the GOAT
222,nbp1oi_00223,I’ve googled natty and got something about body builders. I have no idea what natty is and I wish one of them explained aha Edit: so I googled and 2 people have replied also having googled and we all found different definitions. Seems the Internet wouldn’t of helped jamali at all
223,nbp1oi_00224,"""Taskmaster Island"" [it opens up like the Thunderbirds base and Greg's head pops out]"
224,nbp1oi_00225,Charlotte is just so precious. Lol
225,nbp1oi_00226,Cows lie down when a storms coming aha
226,nbp1oi_00227,The return of Alex's old man scream. Lovely.
227,nbp1oi_00228,What an absurd task I love it
228,nbp1oi_00229,That really was a great task
229,nbp1oi_00230,Definitely Charlotte's episode today
230,nbp1oi_00231,Series won right there unless Sarah cocks up massively
231,nbp1oi_00232,LEE MACK WTFGRHFIKGH
232,nbp1oi_00233,Drama!
233,nbp1oi_00234,"This was easily my favorite episode of this series, a solid run of tasks and entertaining attempts."
234,nbp1oi_00235,I’m so baffled by Alex’s banter
235,nbp1oi_00236,Those kids knitwear are nightmare fuel.
236,nbp1oi_00237,HOLY SHIT LEE NO THAT'S TERRIFYING
237,nbp1oi_00238,Charlotte really deserved the win for that prize
238,nbp1oi_00239,Can Woz close the gap before the finale?
239,nbp1oi_00240,"""Boink""- another one for the tv show!"
240,nbp1oi_00241,wasnt expecting those stones!
241,nbp1oi_00242,Charlotte comeback on the cards

246,nbp1oi_00247,Lee's fucked it lmao
247,nbp1oi_00248,"And with the far off flop of a fish, charlottes guaranteed win might not be in the bag"
248,nbp1oi_00249,DRAMA
249,nbp1oi_00250,Is that the moment that costs Sarah the series?
250,nbp1oi_00251,Do we know what the series scores are? How big is Sarahs lead now?
251,nbp1oi_00252,I want Sarah’s frog jumper
252,nbp1oi_00253,Immediately getting “build the best bridge” vibes and I LIKE IT.
253,nbp1oi_00254,Lee Mack is 96.

257,nbp1oi_00258,Wonder how many relationships Greg just ended
258,nbp1oi_00259,Ya never seen the news?
259,nbp1oi_00260,I see negative scores!
260,nbp1oi_00261,Put it on the stairs and push that over
261,nbp1oi_00262,Ahh wait what?? The new episode is already here??!! What a haze I've been in this week😓!!!!!
262,nbp1oi_00263,Get some chalk and relabel the square you land in?
263,nbp1oi_00264,Is yogurt or poo 😂
264,nbp1oi_00265,I knew it!
265,nbp1oi_00266,How the fuck did I not even spot the hinges on the red box!?
266,nbp1oi_00267,I want someone to hit those fucking VisionExpress moles with a Land Rover
267,nbp1oi_00268,"Break again. Someone less lazy than me, can we get an update on series scores rn?"
268,nbp1oi_00269,"""Mike Wozniak issues a stark warning"" I'm so excited"
269,nbp1oi_00270,Lee's designs for his kids look like they're drawings from some Scandinavian children's book
270,nbp1oi_00271,Jamali's 'NATTY' jumper looks good actually
271,nbp1oi_00272,"I feel like I would 100% just shake the whole thing and call it an earthquake. Like... that's weather, right? Haha."
272,nbp1oi_00273,I love this time of the series when you find those who were weaker early on having evolved and got better. So glad for both Charlotte and Lee who struggled early on.
273,nbp1oi_00274,"So, since we're on a commercial break: Did anyone find out what ""natty"" means? Haha."
274,nbp1oi_00275,I would have stood on a stepladder and pissed on the island from a height.
275,nbp1oi_00276,There's going be something they could have used
276,nbp1oi_00277,Poor Alex.
277,nbp1oi_00278,Poor Alex😅
278,nbp1oi_00279,Wow Sarah
279,nbp1oi_00280,"How close was Woz before today? Just looked, 11 points"
280,nbp1oi_00281,"1, 2, 3, 4. Yes 5 will do."
281,nbp1oi_00282,Garlotte Ritchie
282,nbp1oi_00283,Do you find out who is on the next season at the end of next weeks episode?
283,nbp1oi_00284,"Episode 9 Shit missed the prize task will have to look it up Task one Charlotte put all her kids tv presenter energy into this one Smattering of rain Seeing Charlotte giddy great Task two Alex has been getting a bit lairy recently hasn’t he? Sneaky bastards Ah fuck, poor mike, and lee Task three Reckon we’re going to really see varied approaches with how they approach this based on effort. Yep straight away with lee and jamali lol Stage task Im So confused Well I mean less of a shove and more of a chuck but it was great Fuck if that wasn’t close, it’s the type of shit you see in movies and don’t think would actually happen like that lol Wouldn’t say it’s the been the best episode all round but it was still a decent one, not ready for the series to be over already"
284,nbp1oi_00285,"Wonder if you would get points for ""making it rain"" by flicking notes over the island?"
285,nbp1oi_00286,That is horrific.
286,nbp1oi_00287,That's David baddiel
287,nbp1oi_00288,
288,nbp1oi_00289,
289,nbp1oi_00290,Okay Jamali's is worse
290,nbp1oi_00291,
291,nbp1oi_00292,Sarah's reminds me of that one bit in The Truman Show. Lol
292,nbp1oi_00293,F O G B O I ^TM
293,nbp1oi_00294,
294,nbp1oi_00295,Did they show Woz in the montage? I looked away at some point.
295,nbp1oi_00296,
296,nbp1oi_00297,
297,nbp1oi_00298,CHARLOTTE JAMMIEST WIN EVER??

1,nh8qov_00002,"Incredible series. I only knew the legendary Lee Mack when it was announced and I was a bit letdown by series 10, there's just a surreal energy to it. But anyway, everyone in this series was entertaining in their own right - Charlotte doing her absolute best and hilarious even in failure (reminded me of Mel), Jamali standing by his convictions but also just not giving a shit (reminded me of Romesh), Wozzy was pure and unshakeable and such an unexpected delight (I can see why he won the Fringe Festival precursor to this show), we got much more disaster Lee than I expected and it was delightful, and Sarah just being straightforward and occasionally perplexed by her own success was fantastic (reminded me of Kerry). So great to see everyone in good form, such good tasks this season, and a solid win by Sarah! Can't wait for series 12 AND the 2nd CoC!"
2,nh8qov_00003,Tick Tock Mohawk O'Clock
3,nh8qov_00004,
4,nh8qov_00005,Aren't there any links to the previous episodes? Or at least an discussion overview pinned thread? I'm a bit behind on the episodes
5,nh8qov_00006,"I think Mike‘s hair reveal is the first time I’ve properly audibly gasped at Taskmaster, fucking incredible"
6,nh8qov_00007,"""I can GENUINELY get dr- dressed. Quick."""
7,nh8qov_00008,"I think the important thing is to take away from Season 11 is that no matter who wins or loses, we've all had an absolutely lovely day."
8,nh8qov_00009,"""How much do your boobs weigh? Wheyyyyy!"" 'CBeebies presenter' Charlotte Ritchie"
9,nh8qov_00010,"In my personal opinion, this was probably the best ever episode of Taskmaster which considering its 11 series in, is incredible. Miles hair reveal, Sarah shooting Alex with a staple then failing to direct everyone, Alex dressed as a Roman for no reason, Charlotte claiming she can get dressed quickly, Alex calling Greg grandad, Mike falling over. Just so many incredible moments for one episode"
10,nh8qov_00011,"""I'm picnic girl?"" Oh, Sarah. Lmao."
11,nh8qov_00012,Greg wants Jamali to like him so badly hahahaha
12,nh8qov_00013,"Oh fuck, that arc of sand was flawless"
13,nh8qov_00014,Lee Mack calling Alex Horne Goebbels ahahahahahahha
14,nh8qov_00015,Everytime studio Mike is off-screen I briefly forget about the hair and it shocks me all over again when I see it
15,nh8qov_00016,"""I feel like we're five camels who've just robbed a bank"". A Lee Mack quip - and a cracking one, too - to complete the final task of the series."
16,nh8qov_00017,"Honestly, this is probably my favourite group of contestants Achieving that 11 series in is pretty impressive bc you'd expect most of the 'best' to have been on the show already"
17,nh8qov_00018,Ahahaha Jamali thinking Dara hosts the show is so on par
18,nh8qov_00019,I wish they had done a map of where Charlotte and Jamali walked during their 20 minutes. I feel like it would have been even funnier visualized.
19,nh8qov_00020,The one thing they can't take from Woz is that he absolutely stole our hearts.
20,nh8qov_00021,We're only 10 minutes in and already Mike has shaved half his hair off and Sarah has nearly blinded Alex
21,nh8qov_00022,"""By this time I was sick of his [Alex] shit"" classic Jamali"
22,nh8qov_00023,Charlotte bragging about being able to get dressed quick lmao
23,nh8qov_00024,"""Who's Picnic Girl?"" ""I'M PICNIC GIRL?"" Beautiful"
24,nh8qov_00025,I'm really sad that it's over and we'll never see Mike Wozniak do a task again
25,nh8qov_00026,This has been a season where I was rooting for the entire cast. Lee was my favorite going in but everyone earned a spot in my favorite candidate list and all for different reasons.
26,nh8qov_00027,"""by that time I was already sick of his shit"" God bless Jamali"
27,nh8qov_00028,Is that the first time the contestants have all sat in winning order?
28,nh8qov_00029,"That’s a top 3 series if I’ve ever seen one, the week to week quality is so consistent The most I’ve enjoyed a cast in some time too"
29,nh8qov_00030,post credit scene why was Greg sexy
30,nh8qov_00031,"Things I learnt from this series : Mike Wozniak stole a lot of hearts, likes milk, but he is also batshit crazy Lee Mack is an old angry farmer inside. Still one of the funniest person on the planet Charlotte Ritchie is one of the most sweetest nicest people to ever come on this show I developed a mad crush on Sarah Kendall. The champion of my heart If the ""Taskmaster"" Greg Davies, ever decides to retire. There is only one true successor to him. The Chosen One. Jamali Madix"
31,nh8qov_00032,"He may not have won, but Mike will go down as one of the greatest Taskmaster contestants ever, if not the greatest. Truly the People's Champion."
32,nh8qov_00033,post-credits scene was great. Marvel could never
33,nh8qov_00034,Charlotte's reaction to that time tells us all we need to know about the next segment
34,nh8qov_00035,A comedy fall from Mike there.
35,nh8qov_00036,"""I really think the conclusion might be that your brain weighs nothing at all."" - Charlotte Ritchie"
36,nh8qov_00037,"""then you can have your lives back and be miserable again"" Greg getting a bit too real for my liking there."
37,nh8qov_00038,Mike's hair and Sarah staple gunning Alex in the face. We're barely 5 minutes in and this episode is moving towards classic territory
38,nh8qov_00039,
39,nh8qov_00040,"Absolutely one of the best finale episodes of all seasons. Loved the cast, and loved mike. Quick question though, in the golf task. Couldn’t your first three words be “take off goggles”? There was no mention they had to stay blind folded. Second set of words “walk to circle”."
40,nh8qov_00041,"Brilliant episode to end the series. Mike’s hair reveal was incredible, instantly top 3 TM moments of all time. I loved how he managed to surprise everyone with it. The series scores ended up pretty close in the end, only 4 points in it! Sarah has been nailing it for the whole series though (and literally so tonight lol) so it’s well deserved. I really, really hope Mike Wozniak becomes a star after this. I think this is the first time I didn’t know anything about a contestant before the series started and he’s just been amazing."
41,nh8qov_00042,"Does Alex ever visit this sub or respond on twitter? I just want to thank him for a show that made me genuinely laugh for the first time since I separated from my wife in January. For the hour of that last episode, I was finally able to just laugh and cry tears that weren't about what's going on in life. If you somehow see this Alex, thank you! I will be trying to contact you on twitter also!"
42,nh8qov_00043,"""I'd- It'd be interesting to put you in a bath"". Mike Wozniak"
43,nh8qov_00044,So that’s what Alex meant on the Horne Section podcast when he asked Mike if it had all grown back yet
44,nh8qov_00045,"""TICK TOCK IT'S TOUGH GUY O'CLOCK, YOU WRETCHED STREET RATS"" ""He the guy that shits hisself on telly innit"""
45,nh8qov_00046,"""Could you go down really slowly for me"" Charlotte 'CBeebies' Ritchie"
46,nh8qov_00047,Jamali totally misread 4.0 as 40
47,nh8qov_00048,Fingers crossed Victoria goes for the mohawk as well
48,nh8qov_00049,"If Sarah had told Charlotte and Jamali at the start to ""Wander around randomly"" and then fucked off they might have finished faster than they did."
49,nh8qov_00050,Mike's big reveal had no business being so sexy
50,nh8qov_00051,"Loved Charlotte before this. Absolutely love and adore Charlotte even more, looking forward to her children TV shows going forward."
51,nh8qov_00052,Can we take a moment to appreciate Charlotte's studio outfit? She looks so good!
52,nh8qov_00053,"Sarah’s genuine confusion then outrage at discovering she had earned the moniker “picnic girl” despite having brought in the only thing that would fit in at a picnic, though."
53,nh8qov_00054,"Jamali's vacant expression, save a slight air of disgruntlement, while Charlotte runs behind him, begoggled and tittering, might be my favourite moment of the entire series."
54,nh8qov_00055,Good to see Sarah is a graduate of the Alex Horne school of measurements
55,nh8qov_00056,"I'm glad Sarah won because I find her approach hilarious (and I love her hair, sorry girl). I would have also loved Mike, because obviously, but otherwise... this episode was perfection. Classic insanity every step of the way. Hair reveal Staple gun attack Jamali forgetting Gregs name again Charlotte running in circles like a child trying to evade bath time Llamas + backwards llama"
56,nh8qov_00057,That team task is the hardest I've laughed in ages. Charlotte prancing around aimlessly made me actually fall off my couch.
57,nh8qov_00058,Charlotte with the head shoulders song is back in the CBeebies game
58,nh8qov_00059,"Jamali shaking his head and Charlotte putting hers in her hands, tell me we're in for a treat after the break."
59,nh8qov_00060,"I don't know if anyone else has said it, but Mike really is like a child's imaginary friend come to life."
60,nh8qov_00061,OMG post-credits scene
61,nh8qov_00062,"During the weighing task, Charlotte declared that feet probably weighed less than a head, and to test this theory she started swaying her head back and forth. I mean she was adorable throughout, also sharpest dresser in the studio."
62,nh8qov_00063,"I enjoyed watching Lee and Mike doing the goggle task, but I was wondering why they left that task as the last one. And then the other three were shown."
63,nh8qov_00064,"I said it around episode 2, but Charlotte still feels like someone who made a wish on that 13 Going on 30 wishing dust. Mike feels like we've finally got to spend time with one of Bob's friends from his WILTY stories."
64,nh8qov_00065,Why is he dressed as a Roman though Edit: on the podcast he said there was a very important reason but he won’t reveal it and I’m so annoyed
65,nh8qov_00066,The Roman outfit having no explanation at all leads me to believe that ACTUALLY was a fetish for Alex
66,nh8qov_00067,"Alex just blue balled everyone a wanting ""Mike WozLeeMack"" pun"
67,nh8qov_00068,"Mike's hair reveal was absolutely astonishing - I literally (yes, literally) gasped. Such a fun group of contestants and a fantastic series!"
68,nh8qov_00069,Mike is absolutely going down as one of the best taskmaster contestants ever. I screamed a little
69,nh8qov_00070,Fun fact: On an old James Acaster podcast Mike revealed that he used to have a mohawk. Now we know he was trying to intimidate the street toughs.
70,nh8qov_00071,I'm so bummed Mike's hair got spoiled for me. Mike fans got a little too enthusiastic about that and posted it everywhere with his name right away after it was on a tv preview. sigh But the reactions were great. I like to think the way he acted when he was measuring Alex's weight wasn't dissimilar to how he was as a doctor. My heart sank with the dinosaur task. Figured there was no chance after that. He was actually closer than I thought. I didn't think Charlotte could get more charming but she outdid herself with every task this episode. Incredible. I'm absolutely in love with this cast and this series and I think I'll miss them more than any other. The way all the little running sideplots concluded was perfect.
71,nh8qov_00072,I love how impressed Charlotte was by Mike's mohawk.
72,nh8qov_00073,Jamali has been fucking brilliant
73,nh8qov_00074,"""There's like stinging nettles and shit""—perhaps my fav Jamali line ever"
74,nh8qov_00075,"just finished the episode, with the golf course task this easily climbs up in my rankings just next to sessons 5 & 7 that task is genuinely the funniest thing I've seen on tv for some time"
75,nh8qov_00076,Sexual harassment is only fine between close friends.
76,nh8qov_00077,ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS GIVE HIM A MILLION POINTS
77,nh8qov_00078,the majestic swoop of sand as Mike fell
78,nh8qov_00079,Sarah's instructions were so mind-numbingly awful that Charlotte had to work out the object of the task and then crawl blindfolded towards it. Mesmerising.
79,nh8qov_00080,"Only downside is there goes my dream of David Mitchell and Victoria Coren Mitchell on the same series, unless she wins series 12 and David is on, and wins, one of the next 3 series then they’d both be on CoC!"
80,nh8qov_00081,Is this is the first time that the order they were sat in matched the rankings at the end of the series? It was a nice bit of synergy.
81,nh8qov_00082,"I was really pulling for Mike to win even until the last moments. Only 5 points away. The reveal of the mohawk was a great send-off, though. ""Tick-tock, it's tough guy o'clock."" The ""weigh Alex's feet task"" might be the most unpleasant one I've had to sit through. All those angles. My favorite moment of the episode has to be Mike taking a dive in the bunker. Charlotte was amazing per usual. I like that even at the end, she's still auditioning for that children's show by demonstrating alliteration: ""A lovely load of llamas."" It was a nice touch. Such a great cast and series this was. As Greg says halfway through, now that it's over, I can have my life back and be miserable again. One step ahead of you, old pal. :/"
82,nh8qov_00083,(not to sound like a creep but) is it just me or was everyone especially attractive in this one?
83,nh8qov_00084,"Goodnight, sweet Woz."
84,nh8qov_00085,"Amazing series, and what a finale. Had absolutely everything! Deserved win by Sarah (though I suspected it would happen by how much she was leading from the start). And Charlotte is such a treasure, I want to watch more of her. Is Ghosts any good?"
85,nh8qov_00086,"There's a shot of Jamali in the foreground with Charlotte approaching him from behind, that should be perfect meme fodder."
86,nh8qov_00087,Charlotte calling across the grass then just lying there has me in tears
87,nh8qov_00088,What an awesome episode. So many proper laugh out loud moments amd gasps - Mike's hair OMG!!! This is probably one of my favourite series ever
88,nh8qov_00089,"If Mike thought this hair stunt would stop the Internet from thirsting after him, he was WRONG. Neither a mohawk nor an absolute casserole could stop this endless love."
89,nh8qov_00090,I'm really going to miss this group Honestly by far my favourite
90,nh8qov_00091,How to tell when communication in your team has completely broken down. https://i.imgur.com/4UTJsp7.png
91,nh8qov_00092,
92,nh8qov_00093,Is there any look that Mike can’t pull off
93,nh8qov_00094,"I’m gonna really miss this group. Such a good mesh of people. Sarah absolutely deserved this win, but I’m also really gonna miss Mike, and the rest, like everyone else."
94,nh8qov_00095,"This week on Taskmaster, Alex Horne tries to get an article on WikiFeet."
95,nh8qov_00096,"I think my only criticism with this series in terms of the tasks is that it seemed like there were less tasks where they could approach them however they wanted. The haunted house and airplane safety tasks are the only ones I can think of where they were given a prompt and able to go off with their own ideas. Possibly the weather and ""do something with one hand"" ones would fall under that too but they were still limiting. Those open tasks are where you get a proper insight into the creative minds of the contestants, and I'm sad we didn't see more of that."
96,nh8qov_00097,"The fact that Woz got 1 point for a genuine (albeit tiny) dinosaur and Jamali got 3 for that Dara atrocity... Jesus, Greg. Get your crush figured out."
97,nh8qov_00098,"Aww, goodbye to the best cast we've ever had, and that's some stiff competition. There were no weak links, and even those who were weaker at the start grew into their own with distinctive dynamics, and everyone had some very memorable moments."
98,nh8qov_00099,"This has been my favourite series so far. Mike, Charlotte, Lee, Sarah, I fell in love with them instantly. And the more I saw Jamali’s sass, the more he grew on me. Absolutely wild season, with Mike and Jamali jumping over the fence, the casserole, Sarah’s hair, jamali’s - “you people”, lee’s wit, charlotte’s outfits, and unlike s11 - great prizes. I’m gonna miss this cast so much!!"
99,nh8qov_00100,Please. Anyone. Why was Alex dressed as a centurion.
100,nh8qov_00101,"My all time fav series, considering COVID restrictions it’s a bloody miracle. I want to see Charlotte in everything from now on, but all 5 were truly A+"
101,nh8qov_00102,"Calling it now, Mike has shaved or cut his hair under that crown."
102,nh8qov_00103,"""Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"". Even before the studio and Greg's comments, Charlotte was embracing her imminent career change!"
103,nh8qov_00104,"Every season there's people I'm not familiar with and I end up being absolutely in love with them just a few episodes in. Huge fan of Lee Mack from WILTY but Charlotte is hopelessly adorable, Mike is just an amazing character, Jamali just shithousing every task, and Sarah's often insane logic like in the calendar and weighing task made me a fan of all of them. Amazing lineup, up there with series 7 for me."
104,nh8qov_00105,woz's mohican genuinely suits him
105,nh8qov_00106,We need Dara O’Briain on the show
106,nh8qov_00107,"She’ll be last in the series, but winning the final task is a nice bonus"
107,nh8qov_00108,If they ever do a taskmaster live tour Mike Wozniak should be top of the bill
108,nh8qov_00109,"I've just caught up now and I was in tears from laughing so hard at that team task. As soon as Mike took a tumble in the bunker it was game over. 🤣 My only complaint is that it's a bit of a shame that Sarah had such a big lead going it, because it took away some of the suspense, but she was a deserving winner and my god what an excellent cast and series this was. I'm gonna miss them."
109,nh8qov_00110,Wozniak. He's like bambi on ice.
110,nh8qov_00111,"4 point spread. So had Woz not botched the yogurt task, he would've won. Feels bad."
111,nh8qov_00112,"Genuinely going to miss seeing Jamali on my screen every week, he's so entertaining and charming"
112,nh8qov_00113,"Episode 10 How is it over already? Love mikes hat Prize task - tough theme Sarah is picnic girl Back with his milk Well shit didn’t expect that, go on mike Mr tough guy time, tick tock its tough guy time. Love it Task one - photocopier pachycephalosaurus Few tasks in the garage since they’ve cleared it out now I mean with the tape over it, it does look more like Greg than dara, nvm lol I didn’t think I needed to see Alex and lee like that but I mean it’s there Task two - water weighing Lees method is more accurate, when he’s in the bath he’s moving more than just his head/feet in, should have had him just stick his head/ feet in at the time. Charlottes bring the kids tv presenter into it, love it Task three - masked manoeuvring I mean that sand arch was great Did pretty good I think Jamali just standing there having no clue what’s going on is whilst Charlotte is half running is fucking great Stage task - silhouette suit That is a hairy back, hairier than his legs Fun task but every second out seems unfair. Great outfit, love Sarah’s being on backwards. Great episode and fucking amazing series. Closer than I expected with Sarah’s lead Great cast all round, really like them all, particularly mike and Charlotte (already like lee) and will definitely be checking out other stuff that they’ve done, will be a tough bunch to follow, but Alan and Victoria will be interesting to see. My mum wanted to see mike on this but she passed away just before this series was announced which was upsetting. I’m so so glad that he lived up to what she wanted him to be like and more than a little bit sad that she’ll never get to see it."
113,nh8qov_00114,They’ve been sitting in points order all series
114,nh8qov_00115,"Alan Davies on taskmaster, there’s gotta be a blue whale task in there somewhere"
115,nh8qov_00116,"As everyone else I loved Mike since episode one but I'm not at all sad that Sarah won, I'm genuinely glad for her. As all seasons I never knew any of the contestants and this is definetly one that made me love them the most! Taskmaster just keeps getting better and better."
116,nh8qov_00117,"Charlotte on Taskmaster is the exact opposite of Iain Sterling, who was actually a children’s tv presenter…"
117,nh8qov_00118,"I have a big time soft spot for series 7 since Acaster is my favourite comedian, but that may well have beaten it out to be the best series."
118,nh8qov_00119,"It's kind of lucky that Charlotte didn't just run straight ahead with the first instruction, would have likely face planted into the sand."
119,nh8qov_00120,"I can't shake the feeling that Alex had the weights written down on the costume. Probably on the underside of the headband and foot brace. But it was an excellent season overall. The whole Jamali/Greg dynamic has come a long way from ""wearing black and looking slimming."""
120,nh8qov_00121,Mike's the people's champion
121,nh8qov_00122,‘Feel free to rip it’ - music to Jamali’s ears
122,nh8qov_00123,"S11 was fantastic honestly, went into it only knowing Lee and came out of it just really bummed out that I'm not gonna see any more Taskmaster featuring Mike, Charlotte, Lee or Jamali. Seriously, every single one of them this time around were absolutely fantastic. Just a flawless cast who were all diverse and hit different comedy tones. That final team task with Charlotte running in circles, Mike falling backwards head over heels and Jamali ending up in the bushes was such a perfect way to end this series on. Easily top 3 series of the show alongside S5 and S7 for me. For S12 I'm excited for Victoria Coren Mitchell but really not keen at all on Alan Davies unfortunately. The others are an unknown quantity like the S11 cast were so excited to get to know them!"
123,nh8qov_00124,"The sneakiness of the luggage task feels extra annoying now, ngl, lol. That really did Mike in. The salt/sugar task too but at least that was funny."
124,nh8qov_00125,"Is this the first time a contestant's name is in the episode title? Anyway, what a great season! I'm going to miss Mike's moustache and Sarah's hair a lot."
125,nh8qov_00126,"Just a great season all around. Amazing cast, well thought out and fun tasks, probably only being 7 for me. I was honestly disappointed with season 10 so wasn't expecting a ton from 11 but was happy to be blown away."
126,nh8qov_00127,"Based on Jamali and Charlotte's reaction, Lee and Mike won the task quite comprehensively"
127,nh8qov_00128,Honestly might be my favorite series yet. It's at least top three. This one we really got me threw some tough days and gave me something to look forward to every week. Just really good solid cast here with amazing chemistry.
128,nh8qov_00129,"Gonna miss Mike, but excited to see Sarah return for CoC"
129,nh8qov_00130,11 series and someone is finally sick of Alex’s shit and as much as I love Alex’s shit I’m so here for it.
130,nh8qov_00131,Mike falling on his arse was hilarious Loved the replays
131,nh8qov_00132,HOW IS IT PART FOUR ALREADY?
132,nh8qov_00133,This has got to go down as one of the classic episodes across the entire show. And good to know Charlotte can get dressed quickly.....
133,nh8qov_00134,I’ve enjoyed sarah but I am disappointed Mike won’t be coming back.
134,nh8qov_00135,"Honestly, this is a series where any one of them would have been a worthy winner. Possibly my favourite series of the whole run."
135,nh8qov_00136,Tick tock it’s new series o clock
136,nh8qov_00137,I think that might just be my favourite episode ever. The reveal of the hawk narrowly replaces Joe Wilkinson's potato as my favourite TM moment
137,nh8qov_00138,"""That's like the Human Centipede."" - CBeebies presenter Charlotte Ritchie"
138,nh8qov_00139,
139,nh8qov_00140,As someone born only an hour away from Sarah's hometown I'm immensely chuffed by the results this series. AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE!!!!!!!!!
140,nh8qov_00141,"I don't think the team task actually banned the first instruction being ""take off blindfold"" or ""blindfold off logo""."
141,nh8qov_00142,I just want Mike on every episode of Taskmaster for the rest of time
142,nh8qov_00143,"I just finished the episode, and I’m so"
143,nh8qov_00144,Omg mike what has he done. Gotta love the dedication
144,nh8qov_00145,"I liked the candidates' attitude this season - when in doubt, don't dial down, but just get more outrageous."
145,nh8qov_00146,"""grow some balls grandad"" What the fuck"
146,nh8qov_00147,They really don't deserve 2 points for that terrible showing.
147,nh8qov_00148,"What a series. One of the best. Loved Mike, fell in love with Charlotte, really happy for Sarah. All five contestants were fantastic, had great chemistry with each other and got the spirit of the show"
148,nh8qov_00149,Mike Robbed-niak
149,nh8qov_00150,"C4 announcer confirmed that S12 lineup to be shown straight after the show, let's get hyped"
150,nh8qov_00151,Really looking forward to Guz Khan on taskmaster tbf I love Man like Mobeen
151,nh8qov_00152,Mike Mohawkniak
152,nh8qov_00153,me: it doesn’t even really matter who wins. I don’t care that much. also me: had to pause for nervous diarrhea before studio task scores
153,nh8qov_00154,I'm crying at this episode. it's bloody hilarious
154,nh8qov_00155,"Alan Davies and Victoria Coren Mitchell are in the next series! They'll do me well, I already can't wait!"
155,nh8qov_00156,"Great cast, great series. Next series looks great too, I just fucking love this show tbh"
156,nh8qov_00157,"""Stinging nettles and shit!"" - Jamali Maddox"
157,nh8qov_00158,I'm desperate for Victoria to win - and would have been regardless she's such an amazing personality - because I want to see her and Sarah on CoC together very badly.
158,nh8qov_00159,Was that the first time they actively used the golf course next to the Taskmaster house?
159,nh8qov_00160,"""Close friends."""
160,nh8qov_00161,Mike WozleeMack was right there Alex
161,nh8qov_00162,I'm glad that Lee is wearing his task attire in the studio. I'm waiting for a season when they all wear theirs for a finale
162,nh8qov_00163,Why is this so funny Sarah's instructions are awful lmao
163,nh8qov_00164,The way both me and my housemate screamed when VCM popped up?!?!?!?!?
164,nh8qov_00165,
165,nh8qov_00166,"Today, on Alex's FetishMaster: Feet!"
166,nh8qov_00167,This cast was great and I got my wish of it being rather close in the end rather than an outright stomp. Good chemistry even if the tasks were a bit weaker compared to over seasons. Overall probably top 5. Looking at the 3 - 5 range in terms of seasons. (Season 7 was the best with season 5 being a close second)
167,nh8qov_00168,"Such a funny good show! Found this show just this year. Every episode has been sooooo good hahaha. Been watching it to season 7, and every season is good in its own way."
168,nh8qov_00169,Is Mike starring in the new remake of Taxi Driver?
169,nh8qov_00170,"this has been insane so far, Mike’s Mohawk, Sarah’s Staple Shooting"
170,nh8qov_00171,WE GOT COREN MITCHELL! WE GOT COREN MITCHELL!
171,nh8qov_00172,"Alphabetical leader board, interesting!"
172,nh8qov_00173,"for once i was completely neutral about who i wanted to win, (although i do have a soft spot for charlotte). such a great group, by far my favourite congrats sarah! highlights for me had to be: the whole charlotte cbeebies presenter joke lady gadiva lee on the cow everything mike wozniak did sarah kendall’s hair and jamali and greg’s budding romance"
173,nh8qov_00174,But why was Alex dressed as a roman?
174,nh8qov_00175,"Tick tock, series finale o’clock"
175,nh8qov_00176,Fucking Humblebrag on Charlotte there
176,nh8qov_00177,SERIES 12 LINEUP LOOKS AMAZING AAAAAAAAA
177,nh8qov_00178,"As far as final episodes go, I was a little underwhelmed by the tasks, but this cast is so good they always find a way to elevate it."
178,nh8qov_00179,I am ready for the following Jamali shithousing Wozniak doing bits A Lee Mack fuck up
179,nh8qov_00180,"No rule about decapitating / removing Alex's feet to make it easier. Just ""you can't use the internet""."
180,nh8qov_00181,By far the best episode of the series. Absolute gold. Charlotte crawling literally centimetres past the red circle nailed it.
181,nh8qov_00182,"This was one of my favourite series. For a while, my top 5 series in no particular order were 4, 5, 2, 7 and 9. Now it's 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11."
182,nh8qov_00183,That is one of the best things to ever happen in taskmaster history
183,nh8qov_00184,Greg does have a similar vibe to Dara
184,nh8qov_00185,Haha Alex trying to keep a straight face around Charlotte
185,nh8qov_00186,"""In Charlotte's defence, you have been saying Alex is a tube for some weeks now"" lmfao"
186,nh8qov_00187,I'm glad Greg brought up the swimming in the air bc I forgot it with all the other shit they did
187,nh8qov_00188,Mike's hair in that portait is hysterical
188,nh8qov_00189,"I feel bad for the audience members who have the screenings for just the final episodes, imagining watching the whole series knowing how it ends"
189,nh8qov_00190,"S11 was bloody amazing, so so good. Loved the cast and after seeing the finale in cinemas, the full journey to seeing Sarah win was so satisfying. She really owned this series. Cannot wait to see S12, have seen a lot of VCM, Alan and Desiree, heard of Gus and remember watching Morgana as Natalie Cassidy on 8 out of ten cats and they’re all so funny. Gonna be GOOD!!"
190,nh8qov_00191,"Mostly looking forward to the next series, Guz Khan was one of my wishlist gets and Morgana Robinson is brilliant! I can't believe I never thought of her. Alan Davies should be outstanding as well! I'm not a big VCM fan, but I am interested in seeing how she handles the utter insanity of TM. As for Desiree, I'm not familiar with her but look forward to seeing what she's like! As for this series, I shall miss this cast immensely. There wasn't a dud in the bunch! I was really rooting for Mike, especially after the mohawk reveal, but I figured Sarah's early series lead would be pretty insurmountable. Congrats to her! I look forward to Charlotte's children's show!"
191,nh8qov_00192,"I think they made an effort to make it closer but there was no fixing Sarah having a 20 point lead after 3 episodes. There's been quite a few series where the 2nd and 3rd placed people are the more memorable contestants. Great series though, all five of them were perfect for the show. Just hope we can get back to proper studio audiences by series 13."
192,nh8qov_00193,Sad that Sarah won. Not that she wasn't great. I just would've liked to see one of the others back.
193,nh8qov_00194,This has been my favorite series cast sorry series 9. Going to miss all of them
194,nh8qov_00195,"Jamali with a blinder there. That's a godliman level ""bosh"" item"
195,nh8qov_00196,Holy shit I was not expecting that
196,nh8qov_00197,Josh Widdicombe is quaking
197,nh8qov_00198,i’m probably gonna be the only one to mention it but i love charlotte’s outfit so much haha
198,nh8qov_00199,"""also someone will win a coat hanger"" just reminds you of how silly the prize tasks can be"
199,nh8qov_00200,"Loved Alex's No More Jockeys style ""lure""."
200,nh8qov_00201,AWH MIKE. SO CLOSE <3
201,nh8qov_00202,CONGRATULATIONS SARAH KENDALL
202,nh8qov_00203,Yaaaaaaay Victoria Coren-Mitchell
203,nh8qov_00204,"""Sarah's is a perfect dinosaur""? https://i.imgur.com/gqchG6e.jpg Mike Wozniak was ROBBED!"
204,nh8qov_00205,I have a feeling that the actual weights were actually written inside Alex's headpiece and shin armour.
205,nh8qov_00206,"So it's still pretty true that the odd # series are better than even, S11 was probably in my top 2 with S7."
206,nh8qov_00207,WOZNIAK'S CROWN
207,nh8qov_00208,I've never gasped so loud oh my god Mike
208,nh8qov_00209,picnic girl is fucking pissed and I’m loving it so much
209,nh8qov_00210,"I'm in absolute tears at the ""Left, one, two?"" thing"
210,nh8qov_00211,This is basically the definitive account of Sarah and Jamali and Charlotte's characters.
211,nh8qov_00212,Victoria Coren Mitchell!!
212,nh8qov_00213,Is Morgana Robinson gonna be as mental as her tv roles? I hope so!
213,nh8qov_00214,TOUGH GUY O'CLOCK!!!
214,nh8qov_00215,street toughs
215,nh8qov_00216,Mike’s hair is better than Josh’s tattoo. Dedication that.
216,nh8qov_00217,Sarah's method is how Alex measures everything
217,nh8qov_00218,Charlotte and Jamali’s reaction to Mike and Lee’s time tells me that they were way off of that haha
218,nh8qov_00219,TOUGH GUY O’CLOCK!
219,nh8qov_00220,"I thought Mike might have been bald under the hat, I did not for a second expect him to have a crazy mohawk."
220,nh8qov_00221,"I feel like this is the first series that's really utilized the garage this much. It's interesting how it's basically like a new set, but it's always been there."
221,nh8qov_00222,The Mohawk reveal is up there with the costume task in Taskmaster NZ.
222,nh8qov_00223,That scoring was wack
223,nh8qov_00224,Argh Mike - you did so well on the prize task I had hope. Gregosaurus let us all down
224,nh8qov_00225,Charlotte Ritchie has decimated her CBeebies chances here
225,nh8qov_00226,
226,nh8qov_00227,Alex breaking in the background is great
227,nh8qov_00228,This is a contender for best episode ever
228,nh8qov_00229,YES SARAH!!! IM SO HAPPY!!! I THOUGHT SHE BLEW IT
229,nh8qov_00230,I know everyone was hoping for Mike but I absolutely loved Sarah
230,nh8qov_00231,Genuinely can’t wait for Victoria Coren-Mitchell
231,nh8qov_00232,VCM! And Alan Davies!
232,nh8qov_00233,Bat with a nail in it That's classic Jamali
233,nh8qov_00234,Holy fuck Mike.
234,nh8qov_00235,Just give Mike the series now Also I'm gutted I had that spoiled for me by Sunday Brunch last week
235,nh8qov_00236,I legitimately want a tattoo of Mike Wozniak with that mohawk. Fucking iconic.
236,nh8qov_00237,Sarah staple gunned Alex's top lip ahahaha
237,nh8qov_00238,Mohican Mike looks hot
238,nh8qov_00239,HAIL WOZNIAK
239,nh8qov_00240,This is my favorite episode ever.
240,nh8qov_00241,"you know the next part is gonna be good, the way Charlotte put her head in her hands"
241,nh8qov_00242,"If I was having to direct 2 people, my first instruction would be ""Jamali, ignore everything!"""
242,nh8qov_00243,VICTORIA
243,nh8qov_00244,Lmao Sarah didn't realise she's picnic girl
244,nh8qov_00245,Oh my god! Tough guy o clock
245,nh8qov_00246,Mike is just iconic
246,nh8qov_00247,Does anyone else think mike’s tough guy face looks a lot like Arthur Shelby
247,nh8qov_00248,Dara O’Bryan
248,nh8qov_00249,One part in and I can tell this is going to be one hell of an episode
249,nh8qov_00250,"So I believe we’ve already heard the series 12 lineup and it’s promising But man am I gonna miss these five, one of the best groups they’ve had"
250,nh8qov_00251,"I'm guessing the title will come in with Sarah shouting ""Activate Jamali!"" to get him to start moving towards the target. (unless I've missed it already)"
251,nh8qov_00252,"""The fuck?"" Oh, Greg. Lmao."
252,nh8qov_00253,Jamali just chilling
253,nh8qov_00254,WHAT IS SARAH DOING? I'M LOSING IT!
254,nh8qov_00255,New series of Naked Attraction looks good
255,nh8qov_00256,BAMBOO TIME
256,nh8qov_00257,I'm really gonna miss Charlotte <3
257,nh8qov_00258,Night time milk lol
258,nh8qov_00259,OMG GIVE MIKE ALL OF THE POINTS EVER.
259,nh8qov_00260,no fucking way MIKE WHAT
260,nh8qov_00261,Oh my god. Mike went all out for the prize task. I wasn't expecting that.
261,nh8qov_00262,First the mohawk and now Sarah almost takes out Alex's eye. This episode is already nuts.
262,nh8qov_00263,Aww Charlottes was my favourite
263,nh8qov_00264,How is Alex's arse so pink? Plenty of rouge on those cheeks eh lad
264,nh8qov_00265,It's 3 AM in the morning and my internet broke down after five minutes. ...I forgot to pay my bills. 😭 Welp. See you later gang.
265,nh8qov_00266,"I had a sip of water just before Alex said ""grow some balls, grandad"" Bad move"
266,nh8qov_00267,This is fucking hysterical
267,nh8qov_00268,haha Activate Jamali
268,nh8qov_00269,They predicted the final scores at the start of the series with that seating order.
269,nh8qov_00270,New line up is 👌😘
270,nh8qov_00271,Alan Davies! Guz Khan! Victoria coren Mitchell!
271,nh8qov_00272,That was genuinely my favourite ever episode of TM. Absolutely hilarious.
272,nh8qov_00273,"Jamali reaches new levels of glory with his Tough Item. Bat With a Nail In. It's simple, it's effective, it'll get you put on several government watchlists"
273,nh8qov_00274,"Omg Mike is committed That's unreal ahahaha ""tick tock, it's tough guy o'clock"""
274,nh8qov_00275,HOLY FUCK THAT MOHAWK
275,nh8qov_00276,Lmaoooo I love Charlotte Ritchie
276,nh8qov_00277,"There's gotta be answers somewhere, Man. Alex's weird Roman thing is just so... weird."
277,nh8qov_00278,THAT'S FROM THE TITLE SEQUENCE
278,nh8qov_00279,Oh Charlotte I love you so much.
279,nh8qov_00280,Alex in the background of that task was so funny
280,nh8qov_00281,You know it’s good when Alex is bent over laughing.
281,nh8qov_00282,oh it's over :(((
282,nh8qov_00283,
283,nh8qov_00284,That is stunning.
284,nh8qov_00285,Mike's hair is amazing. Tik tok it's tough guy o'clock.
285,nh8qov_00286,NO FUCKING WAY MOHAWK MIKE
286,nh8qov_00287,This is shaping up to be the best finale.
287,nh8qov_00288,This is one of my favourite lil background music pieces btw for no ones interest
288,nh8qov_00289,Those prize task scores made me think Woz could claw this back but I'm now less convinced. Gonna be close
289,nh8qov_00290,Sarah's method is...interesting
290,nh8qov_00291,Sarah using a watermelon and fish sticks and getting... oddly close is giving me Tim Vine with the lobster vibes.
291,nh8qov_00292,"""You naughty llama"""
292,nh8qov_00293,Oh lord Mike
293,nh8qov_00294,Holy shit Mike!
294,nh8qov_00295,Holy fuck
295,nh8qov_00296,
296,nh8qov_00297,No lie Mike fully suits that
297,nh8qov_00298,How did Jamali do better than Charlotte? Gregs obsession with Jamali is a real negative of this series.
298,nh8qov_00299,Finally we get some watermelon
299,nh8qov_00300,"South East, you muppet Lee 😂"
300,nh8qov_00301,that swoop of sand was so perfect
301,nh8qov_00302,Yes. Fight back little Alex
302,nh8qov_00303,Fucking hell
303,nh8qov_00304,Alan Davies and Victoria Coren Mitchell are the only ones I know from them but I’m always excited anyway!
304,nh8qov_00305,Can someone please tell me what Alex's feet and head actually weighed?
305,nh8qov_00306,Ready to see Jamali go balls to the walls if the title is anything to go off
306,nh8qov_00307,"""My biological son, Little Alex Horne!"""
307,nh8qov_00308,So that's whats growing back
308,nh8qov_00309,OH MY GOD MIKE
309,nh8qov_00310,IT SUITS HIM
310,nh8qov_00311,Holy shit!
311,nh8qov_00312,Holy shit Mike! Going out with a bang and a half!
312,nh8qov_00313,MIKEHAWK
313,nh8qov_00314,Ooh you mad bugger
314,nh8qov_00315,"In case it was bothering anyone else like it was me, the Mole from that Vision Express ad is voiced by Gavin from Gavin and Stacey"
315,nh8qov_00316,"""There's a lot of stuff about how much my head weighs on the internet"" - Alex Horne"
316,nh8qov_00317,WHERE’S THE MONEY LEBOWSKI ?!
317,nh8qov_00318,I can't stop laughing
318,nh8qov_00319,Naked attraction taskmaster cross over?
319,nh8qov_00320,"They must broken the rules though? There's no way Sarah waited 30 seconds between her directions. By the end she was just talking to them, lol."
320,nh8qov_00321,YAY CHARLOTTE
321,nh8qov_00322,WOO JAMALI
322,nh8qov_00323,What shirt was Charlotte wearing?
323,nh8qov_00324,Wozniak's headgear is on point.
324,nh8qov_00325,WOZNIAK IS FINALLY WEARING A KINGLY CROWN
325,nh8qov_00326,I think Mike has shaved his head for this
326,nh8qov_00327,Night time milk
327,nh8qov_00328,!!!!!
328,nh8qov_00329,MIKE NO
329,nh8qov_00330,Punk is back!
330,nh8qov_00331,Mike's going for those points!
331,nh8qov_00332,Sarah just tried to kill Alex
332,nh8qov_00333,
333,nh8qov_00334,Genuine question: What's the potentially harmful part of photocopying yourself that made Channel 4 make Alex make that 'don't try this at home' comment? Is it the light or something?
334,nh8qov_00335,Jamali overscored again? I actually really liked Mike's dinosaur
335,nh8qov_00336,I feel like this burger king advert is just trying to rip off Daisy May Cooper's Kerry character from This Country.
336,nh8qov_00337,Jamali casually predicting 40kg as the weight of Alex's head
337,nh8qov_00338,Sarahs definitely won at this point unless Mike pulls something incredible out the bag
338,nh8qov_00339,"Wait was there not some sort of “in the most scientific way” stipulation? What was the wording? I didn’t think it was worded just like, whoever is closest"
339,nh8qov_00340,charlotte <3
340,nh8qov_00341,Alex ignored blatant rule violations. That took a loooooooong time.
341,nh8qov_00342,Alex Horne is such a strange bloke
342,nh8qov_00343,Series 12... HERE WE GO...
343,nh8qov_00344,I'm so excited for Alan Davies I'm ngl
344,nh8qov_00345,The haunting sound of a hemorrhoid popping out.
345,nh8qov_00346,Horne with a classic luuueere there. Expecting Watto to challenge any minute now
346,nh8qov_00347,Charlotte making a decent fist of auditioning for the Backstreet Boys with that cap.
347,nh8qov_00348,Mike's shaved his head to make himself look tough. Because of course he has.
348,nh8qov_00349,"""make the best picture of a big scary dinosaur"" draws greg davies"
349,nh8qov_00350,I’ve always thought Greg looks like a penis sausage.
350,nh8qov_00351,This photocoying feels like it is breaking a great many Health and Safety laws and somewhere in the bowels of Channel 4s' legal department a lawyer has just woke up and started screaming.
351,nh8qov_00352,Human centipede Lee mack version
352,nh8qov_00353,Mike hawk’s long
353,nh8qov_00354,"I shouldn't have logged onto twitter.I shouldn't have logged onto twitter.I shouldn't have logged onto twitter. Saw Mike's hair from Alex/the Taskmaster acct's tweet. Damnit, me, damnit. Spoil't yourself."
354,nh8qov_00355,
355,nh8qov_00356,Poor Alex having to lift such a heavy head every day.
356,nh8qov_00357,"I think that, by getting closer than Mike on the Alex weighing task, Sarah has definitively put him out of the contest."
357,nh8qov_00358,
358,nh8qov_00359,Best episode ever
359,nh8qov_00360,Going to miss this group so much
360,nh8qov_00361,Baby got back.
361,nh8qov_00362,Naked attraction?

364,nh8qov_00365,Great series.
365,nh8qov_00366,Next series lineup incoming!
366,nh8qov_00367,What time does the podcast normally go up? I don’t usually listen till the next day but wanted to listen right away tonight
367,nh8qov_00368,If this finale is as good as the rest of the series then imo this would be the best series of taskmaster
368,nh8qov_00369,"The commercial just stated that they're ""revealing the series 12 contestants straight after"". Oh, Channel 4. We've known everyone but VCM for months now. Haha."
369,nh8qov_00370,ACTIVATE JAMALI
370,nh8qov_00371,THAT SOUND 😂
371,nh8qov_00372,"Mikes noise had to be the hernia popping like, surprised they didn’t use lee licking the table"
372,nh8qov_00373,"Fuck, I cannot wait to see Alex’s back."
373,nh8qov_00374,Baby (Alex) Got Back.
374,nh8qov_00375,Lee wearing his cape!!
375,nh8qov_00376,That survival backpack is tragic.

380,nh8qov_00381,Oh my
381,nh8qov_00382,What a mikehawk
382,nh8qov_00383,Well played lee
383,nh8qov_00384,"I can't wait for someone on this sub to make fanart of these dinosaurs, esp Lee's."
384,nh8qov_00385,Charlotte's looked like Reptar from the Rugrats.
385,nh8qov_00386,Shit housing Jamali
386,nh8qov_00387,"Oh this team task is looking good, potential for pure chaos"
387,nh8qov_00388,Sarah's proper fucked it here lmao
388,nh8qov_00389,Charlotte is just adorable
389,nh8qov_00390,"Ooosh, what a back!"
390,nh8qov_00391,What’s this post credit thing? It wasn’t in the all4 stream
391,nh8qov_00392,Tick tick!
392,nh8qov_00393,Next series cast released after!
393,nh8qov_00394,I haven’t missed a cast like I will this lot since the first 5 series.
394,nh8qov_00395,Waaaah
395,nh8qov_00396,Hair!
396,nh8qov_00397,You might call me a biased Wozmaniak but I reckon deduct some of Sarah’s points for maliciously attacking Alex with the staple gun.
397,nh8qov_00398,This photocopier task is wonderfully creative
398,nh8qov_00399,This might have cost Woz the series
399,nh8qov_00400,
400,nh8qov_00401,40kg hahahaha
401,nh8qov_00402,Roll credits!
402,nh8qov_00403,"I won't be able to watch live, but I hope everyone enjoys the show!!! ❤️"
403,nh8qov_00404,have they filmed the next series already? they just said they're announcing the cast after this episode ends. i thought it was champion of champions next anyway
404,nh8qov_00405,"I'm calling it now, he's got the winners face shaved into his back."
405,nh8qov_00406,Charlotte should have done better with all those years experience presenting children's telly
406,nh8qov_00407,The implication that the weight of Alex's feet is avaliable online...
407,nh8qov_00408,Charlotte going last has worried me
408,nh8qov_00409,
409,nh8qov_00410,
410,nh8qov_00411,Remember Alex's back.
411,nh8qov_00412,
412,nh8qov_00413,Hairy
413,nh8qov_00414,Oh god what's this Naked Attraction shit
414,nh8qov_00415,Tie? Edit: Hah I'm an idiot for some reason I thought Lee was 7 points behind Sarah.
415,nh8qov_00416,
416,nh8qov_00417,
417,nh8qov_00418,It's all going to come down to the final studio task
418,nh8qov_00419,
419,nh8qov_00420,What Alex?
420,nh8qov_00421,
421,nh8qov_00422,
0,oew32i_00001,I feel like the tone is really set for how chaotic this series would be when David asked Paul if he could drive the car then asked Can you teach me how to drive then it cuts to a clip of him nearly hitting a fence with the truck.
1,oew32i_00002,"I really enjoyed S1 but the show is already feeling a lot more confident with itself just with the opening episode. Straight away it feels like there's more energy between the contestants. Some better back and forths with the Taskmaster and so on. (Jeremy having an established working relationship with one of them I think will help the banter as the series goes on). Fun, simple tasks. Imaginative solutions (for the most part). Looking forward to Ep2 and the rest."
2,oew32i_00003,Look I know he is your big name (for non nzers Jeremy is hugely famous by nz comedy standards) but please replace Jeremy as the taskmaster. He's not right for it and everything else in the show is working but taskmaster is so important it's killing it
3,oew32i_00004,"Woohoo, it's back. The Fly task was utterly shit though, green screen was the only way to do it and that's just not fun to show on screen. The bowling pins task was the highlight for me - I was like ""yeah, i'd totally blindfold Paul and direct him around"" but David's solution was MUCH better."
4,oew32i_00005,David Correos gives me major Gene Belcher vibes lol
5,oew32i_00006,Honestly this is the first time I've said this for a Taskmaster series (Apart from Taskmaster USA but that was just bad) but I think I need more time for them to grow on me.
6,oew32i_00007,"So glad it's back. There's just something a bit grinding about TMUK lately, TMNZ feels way closer to the original concept. Maybe it's just familiarity and routine that seems to be bogging the UK version down. Much as I truly adore Greg Davies and Alex Horne and everything that's done in Chiswick, I would much rather watch (or even participate) in a task like ""Fly - You have 20 minutes"" than ""Blow up and tie the balloon so that it's bigger than your head, neatly gift wrap the balloon and eat three whole poppadoms. You must also say the word ""metronome"" between each tick of the metronome. You may not touch or stop the metronome."" Seems like a lot of the recent tasks in TMUK are complicated strings of conditions and restrictions to be followed while doing something that borders on ""Purple Monkey Dishwasher"" random, and they didn't used to be like that. I prefer the open-to-interpretation tasks like ""Impress this mayor"" or ""Surprise Alex"" over ""try to paint a wolf on this spinning thing"" -- those are fun in a different way, but I do prefer the ones that allow contestants to go as far afield as they want. Also Jeremy Wells is an unnaturally handsome man, yet somehow only possesses a tenth of the magnificent beast sex appeal as Greg flicks casually from the end of his finger."
7,oew32i_00008,"Very good start to the season. Pro: TM NZ continues to prove that very simple, open ended tasks work really well. A lot of creativity from the contests. Con: None of these people can throw a shoe worth a damn."
8,oew32i_00009,Cracking first episode. Totally rooting for David and Guy (although the others were also fun). Really hope Guy wears a shirt of Paul every episode
9,oew32i_00010,something tells me “one point for Guy” will become a familiar phrase once again
10,oew32i_00011,So good so far. Really funny cast. Jeremy grown more into the role which is great to see!
11,oew32i_00012,"This cast is already mental and I love it. David looks like he’s going to be my surprise favorite this series, and Urzila and Guy are living up to my hopes for them prior to the series. Beyond happy it’s back, it’s filling the TMUK void until September and it feels like it’s really coming into its own this series."
12,oew32i_00013,I noted that Brynley Stent and Angella Dravid both got writing credits for this show.
13,oew32i_00014,"I watched this episode (and 4 others) in person. I wrote up about general production differences from Season 1, and also a bunch of details that didn't make the final cut from this episode in a comment on the r/panelshow post: https://www.reddit.com/r/panelshow/comments/ofghhu/taskmaster_nz_s02e01_flight_of_fantasy_david/h4fcj3v"
14,oew32i_00015,"Very good start! One of the strongest opening episodes ever? At least out of UK and NZ. It feels like they're all fully engaged with each other already, not detecting any weak links in the cast. And Jeremy's still got his more...subdued? take on the TM going on, but he seemed to be prodding fun at them a bit more than he used to. At this stage I'm team David, but Laura's dry wit has won me over too. I love Guy and his interesting shirt collection. What's the betting Guy Williams has a hand in that?"
15,oew32i_00016,Love thus cast so much already. Guy is not a dissapointment
16,oew32i_00017,And Guy's t-shirt/s are amazing...
17,oew32i_00018,"For a first episode, it was absolutely chaotic. A very good start for season 2 and what might possibly be one of my favorite prize tasks in TM history."
18,oew32i_00019,"What a great start! By watching this the people who tanked the whole thing in the US could learn that you don't want mean idiots randomly insulting Lil' AH and weird flexing all the time, you want mad cunts who are willing to embarass themselves on the telly for ten consecutive weeks"
19,oew32i_00020,One Point to Guy should be the subtitle for this show.
20,oew32i_00021,"Fantastic. I totally lost it when Matt ""flew"" with the noodles attached to his harms. Just an absolutely hilarious sight."
21,oew32i_00022,"Like Paul's new haircut! He really is very involved in all the tasks this week, never just the guy with a stopwatch. For the toothbrush one, I did consider dangling from a height but I also wondered would it be possible to get a remote control vibrator (the ones where you can use an app at work to operate the one your partner may have at home), attach that to a normal toothbrush on a stand and set it off from miles away. Genius to ask Paul to put the bowling pins right next to the caravan."
22,oew32i_00023,I can already tell I'm gonna be Team David! A very solid and fun first episode
23,oew32i_00024,
24,oew32i_00025,"Great first episode, loved it. Only 1 gripe I had though. Why did Laura get anything more than 1 point for ""her"" brushing?"
25,oew32i_00026,Hopefully this shows up on YouTube soon for uk viewers - big fan of the first season!
26,oew32i_00027,"Possibly weird question, but can somebody knowledgeable on NZ tell me what kind of relative fame the contestants are at? Like I'd guess David is the newest. But are the rest like minor celebs, household names, national treasures or what? Probably not pertinent, but just curious."
27,oew32i_00028,Thank God Guy shaved off the tache he had some time ago and reverted to the lanky sex bomb I dream of at night
28,oew32i_00029,"So good. Jeremy and Paul on top form, a bit more abusive but still in a good natured way. Very clever tasks and very diverse array of attempts - the cast is good and nobody dominates too much. Looking forward to the next ep."
29,oew32i_00030,
30,oew32i_00031,"It's off to a very strong start. Cast seems to be strong, and it was very strong start with the prize task. And it was very good to see Matt Heath channelling his ""Back of the Y Masterpiece Television"" days at one point."
31,oew32i_00032,"mixed bag of a season opener. can't place why. already rooting for Guy and especially David, Laura (Lauren?) looks tons of fun too but I'm struggling a bit with the older folks."
32,oew32i_00033,Solid first ep. First task was probably my favourite. David definitely had the strategy worked out just needed to think of it sooner. Solid cast probably will be better than last season but has the benefit of not being the first season. The preview for next week looks good.
33,oew32i_00034,Has anyone got a link for this
34,oew32i_00035,I recommend everyone listen to Matt and Jeremys radio show/ podcast Their chemistry is awesome https://www.iheart.com/podcast/211-the-hauraki-breakfast-with-28147412/
35,oew32i_00036,

0,ojwo8q_00001,"Friendly reminder to not post links to unofficial copies of the episode. That includes linking to other subreddits, files on Google Drive, Mega or Youtube. The only official source online is the TVNZ website."
1,ojwo8q_00002,"David’s over-preparation in the sunscreen task reminds me of poor Lee Mack putting so much effort into building his tower for the yogurt task, only to be thwarted by a freak accident/technicality lol. Given Taskmaster’s track record with helium-related tasks, I was genuinely expecting someone to try and blow some helium into an egg a Brussels sprout"
2,ojwo8q_00003,"I genuinely think this was one of the greatest Taskmaster episodes ever full stop. David's transformation, the brussel sprout saga, David climbing into the rafters, everyone fucking up the sunscreen except the one person who just bashed the sunscreen, the demon painting of Jeremy's mother. Just absolutely everything you could want from Taskmaster."
3,ojwo8q_00004,I haven't checked yet but can the hanging bucket be seen in episode 1?
4,ojwo8q_00005,I’m gonna get heat stroke sometime this week
5,ojwo8q_00006,
6,ojwo8q_00007,This is top five funniest episode of any season in any country. Was screaming all the way.
7,ojwo8q_00008,
8,ojwo8q_00009,"David is all time amazing so far. Smart enough to think of mixing the sunscreen with water, determined enough to build a giant slide for it, insane enough to mix the water in his mouth and incompetent enough for it all to fall apart despite his pretty good plans. He is Mark Watson on absolute steroids."
9,ojwo8q_00010,David was robbed! I was sure his 'Let there be dark' performance would be an easy 5 points - that was an all-time Taskmaster moment. So to get just 1 is pretty crazy.
10,ojwo8q_00011,"I officially love David Correos now. The dedication he gave to getting those balloons down (I was TERRIFIED for him when he got up on those cabinets) and then losing his shit when they started to move on to another task. Not because of his result, but because he wanted Laura to be recognized for a great approach to the task. Totally won me over."
11,ojwo8q_00012,David's die-hard commitment and willingness to humiliate himself for points combined with his incompetence and/or bad luck preventing him from actually getting those points makes him the ideal taskmaster contestant.
12,ojwo8q_00013,"Is this the first episode in TM NZ ever to not feature the phrase ""One point for Guy""?"
13,ojwo8q_00014,"Paul is amazing. He's an attractive guy which usually makes physical comedy more difficult lol, but he manages to carry himself in such an awkward way, and folds in on himself in the studio. Their banter with Urzila was absolutely top tier"
14,ojwo8q_00015,How is it that David is putting sunblock in his mouth repeatedly and nobody is even mentioning it?! What an episode!
15,ojwo8q_00016,Just wanted to point out that I thought Jeremy was amazing in this episode. Especially in the beginning during the prize tasks. I think he feels a bit more confident with a Matt to make fun of (it's a bit like the Rhod-Greg dynamic) Btw I hugely enjoy the contestants bringing pictures of Jeremy in.
16,ojwo8q_00017,I hope Guy has a new Paul shirt every week
17,ojwo8q_00018,
18,ojwo8q_00019,"What an episode! I'd put the sunscreen task up against anything, not only for its own antics but for the callback consequences to the brussels sprout task. I definitely thought of floating the sprout in a bucket of water in the moment. I would have lowered it like Laura. I might have dumped the water onto the ground voluntarily at the end as I wouldn't have understood that they'd keep counting it indefinitely. I wish they had cut to a live check in to the brussels sprout. It would have gotten an ovation. For the blackout task, I would have done a murder mystery. After the blackout I would've been the dead body with a knife sticking out of me in a pool of blood, crew would be dressed as rich relatives, and Paul would have had a monologue about how everyone here had a motive for the murder. Or else get some cans of paint and throw as much onto the plastic on the walls as possible. I know that Jeremy isn't the most dynamic Taskmaster, but I am getting fascinated by his larger persona as judged by the sheer number of times people bring in stuff to riff on his outside persona. From Madeline's Cricket references, Angela's book of things the Taskmaster doesn't want to see, the hot pictures this episode, the various pictures of Jeremy from the past.... He's obviously a big deal in the little pond that is New Zealand. It's like if we got Jay Leno to be Taskmaster at the peak of his ubiquity."
19,ojwo8q_00020,"This episode is probably in my top 5 favorite episodes of Taskmaster. This had everything, the ? scoring, the task within a task, nudity, the cup bottoming out, overthinking and a damn funny live task. I had tears in my eyes at multiple points. Absolutely fantastic!"
20,ojwo8q_00021,So glad David Correos is making a splash. A couple of brilliant moments in this ep—the Brussel sprouts and the room makeover. Really enjoying this season so far. All I still hope for is that we’ll see some Matt Heath antics worthy of Back of the Y.
21,ojwo8q_00022,"Hard not to love David. He's pretty much the quintessential TM contestant of someone trying so hard and thinking they've nailed it with a workaround, and then failing spectacularly. He definitely should've been rewarded for his room makeover, especially considering he had the opportunity to redo it due to the mistake but said nope, that's our moment! And also...I know it's too late now, but it was odd to me how Paul said the sunscreen had to stay on the plinth, yet they counted David's squirt from his mouth, not the plinth...oh well. I guess it landing on the tarp takes priority"
22,ojwo8q_00023,So much going on in the sunscreen task with David. 😱
23,ojwo8q_00024,
24,ojwo8q_00025,"Welp, I fancy Guy."
25,ojwo8q_00026,"Probably my favourite episode of NZ Taskmaster so far, it was brilliant and it speaks to how well-cast this series was. As always I love the simple tasks, and David was especially memorable this episode in all three tasks and in the studio. Too early to call who'll win."
26,ojwo8q_00027,This episode is up there as one of the best Taskmaster episodes
27,ojwo8q_00028,"Season 2 is off to a cracking start! The contestants are all batty as hell, and have great banter with each other in studio too. I thought Guy was going to be my favourite to start, but I can’t help feeling that David is going to wiggle his way to the top there, he’s absolutely hilarious from the way he interprets tasks to how he reacts in studio and cracks up at pretty much anything anyone else says!"
28,ojwo8q_00029,"This season is fantastic so far. The ongoing brussel sprout imbroglio is totally unique to taskmaster I think. Somebody send these tasks to Alex, they are just so simple, let the crazy contestants do their thing, that's what we want to see."
29,ojwo8q_00030,Loved Urzila showing Paul how to pole dance and bossing him around. :D
30,ojwo8q_00031,"so I went to the taping of this very episode and I'm still very disappointed the episode wasn't called ""Clearance squirt."""
31,ojwo8q_00032,"This was such a delightful episode, I swear this series keeps getting better. The lab transformation task was absolutely wild (poor David). Also, if I’m not mistaken, this has to be the earliest in any episode that the title has been mentioned! Laura said “heat stroke” pretty early in the prize task."
32,ojwo8q_00033,David is just a big brown cuddly ball of human emotions!
33,ojwo8q_00034,"Anybody else notice the Series 11 themes playing throughout the episode? Also, loved David in this episode. Definitely think he should have got more than 1 point for his room transformation"
34,ojwo8q_00035,So much props to the task planning team on this episode. All the tasks I thought brilliantly gave the contestants a chance to come up with different amusing creative things. Just an absolute cracking episode.
35,ojwo8q_00036,"I really dislike that I hate on Jeremy, but he continues to bog down the brilliance of TM NZ. Paul's fantastic. The casts have been amazing. But Jeremy's judgment and reactions/non-reactions in general always changes the room far more than any of the contestants could the lab. After the first series, I would've hoped that he would settle and relax into the role, and maybe he still will, but he currently remains a dud. I have gripes about Greg's scoring as well but at least Greg can recognize and appreciate effort and result, even if they're failures. And any time the contestants bite back, Greg meets them with a similar energy. David is putting together a series-wide legendary performance and we're only two episodes in. It has to already be among the best all-time (UK series included, if not all TMs). At the least, he's already racked up a handful of most memorable task performances. And he's being underscored. I really hope that doesn't remain the case. As of now though, he's obviously only being justly scored in objective tasks"
36,ojwo8q_00037,This was an absolute banger of an episode. It just kept on giving!
37,ojwo8q_00038,David is obviously not afraid of exposing himself...
38,ojwo8q_00039,I need gifs of all of David's reactions.
39,ojwo8q_00040,"I'm liking Guy too. He gives off a bit of a John Lurie vibe, if only for the hat."
40,ojwo8q_00041,"Laura deserves five points in the floating task, no one disputes that. Buuuuut... there's no way there was still water in that bucket after 74 days. Water evaporates. The brussel sprout would have been aloft, but resting on the bottom of the bucket. It's a minor quibble, I'm sure if Guy's pan still had water after three days, then her bucket would have as well. But I question the final count."
41,ojwo8q_00042,"First ad break. Strong prize task, but not sure had Greg had photos out there like Jerry if contestants would use them. Definitely not scared to tease him. But Jerry got some strong lines in especially at Paul's expense. First real task definitely having a 2 story house helps making tasks different. Will be interested how other 3 go. Cant say I'm surprised by Matts attempt."
42,ojwo8q_00043,"If they counted it starting from when the Brussel sprout stopped floating, surely Laura should have got the lowest score because when they gave her the points it was still floating"
0,ooimhz_00001,I would have crushed that weetbix task. I only eat them dry and used to eat an embarrassingly large amount every day.
1,ooimhz_00002,Where's the ep4 discussion?
2,ooimhz_00003,Who would win if Detective Reginald Bathgate and Benoit Blanc had to solve the same crime?
3,ooimhz_00004,"Wow. David's film was hilarious and his voice acting was PERFECT Oh god, the difference between the two teams! ""You two look like you had made love at some point..."" - I burst out laughing at this one. Jeremy really is growing into his role; I feel like he's become more comfortable as the Taskmaster Urzila was hilarious in the hop task! This ep is great!"
4,ooimhz_00005,"I had been watching the UK version with my parents, who are Kiwis, and they requested that we check out the NZ version. I let them know I had serious reservations as A) NZ takes on international shows are generally painfully cringy b) Greg is the taskmaster and while Jeremy Wells was iconic on eating media lunch- he's now on like a fluff magazine news show so I couldn't imagine how that energy would translate C) the only contestant I recognized was Ursula. My dad recognized 2/5. They asked it turn it off after the ""most characters"" task."
5,ooimhz_00006,Dying to find out where Guy got the jumper he wore in the studio!
6,ooimhz_00007,"I know there's been enough ragging on Taskmaster UK's overprotective rulings, but that hopscotch task in the UK would totally have not worked with Alex's ""You cannot lift the table, you cannot use a container, you cannot spill a drop, you cannot move without hopping, etc."" I'm really glad NZ trusts their competitors."
7,ooimhz_00008,David Correos is SO EXTRA and I am absolutely here for it.
8,ooimhz_00009,I love how Guy switched into another t shirt of Paul and Paul just chose not to acknowledge it
9,ooimhz_00010,"David's voice acting was on point. Guy's Olympics (and flying, but that was another ep surely?) was so well done. I love this group, but David is on another level of pure. When he ran to give the coin to the Taskmaster at the end... This format is so good for his kind of comedy."
10,ooimhz_00011,"David was robbed in the prize task! Especially since most the other things also were not indigenous to NZ either! Especially Guy's and Ursula's task. For those not from New Zealand, every second household has a feijoa tree and for about a month a year they all fruit heavily at once so there are hundreds of thousands of them being passed from neighbour to neighbour (traditionally in plastic supermarket bags which are now banned) and snuck into every baked dish available. Then suddenly they just disappear completely for 11 months."
11,ooimhz_00012,"I can't wait to see more of Matt's cheating, especially if that's going to be David's reaction every time. Also, the task that resulted in Laura drinking half a bottle of wine sounds like it could be a banger. Is NZ Taskmaster the drinkiest of all the Taskmasters?"
12,ooimhz_00013,"Last week, I broke up with my boyfriend. This week my job went into lockdown. Thank god for new episodes of Taskmaster."
13,ooimhz_00014,I LOVE THEM I LOVE THEM ALL Was truly surprised no one brought in a fish poster for most New Zealand thing
14,ooimhz_00015,"Loved Jeremey making fun at Guys white guy Olympics , and also excellent that Guy didn't fall for using blackface."
15,ooimhz_00016,
16,ooimhz_00017,"Another fantastic episode. This is shaping up to be one of the best Taskmaster series ever. I'm secretly rooting for Guy, but Laura is adorably enthusiastic and David may be the most purely loveable contest ever. I love that he can't help but run everywhere."
17,ooimhz_00018,Matt's comment about 'cheating in all the other (team) tasks' - does this kind of make him a cross between Rhod Gilbert (friend of the Taskmaster) and Dave Gorman (extensive cheating)?
18,ooimhz_00019,The Weta statues might be the coolest prize ever.
19,ooimhz_00020,"I'm getting the feeling the teams are going to have a similar dynamic to those of season 9. Also, dry weetbix are not flavourless, they have a faintly pleasant taste."
20,ooimhz_00021,Guy's photo in Dallas was s a v a g e
21,ooimhz_00022,"Maybe not as iconic as last week's episode but a very strong episode nevertheless. The scotch task was my favourite. Wasn't quite so keen on the film task but that's taste I guess - I think I would've liked it more if there was a bonus point for best film. I thought these would be the teams and I like the dynamics as well as this rivalry Matt and David have, reminded me of Rhod and James. Seems to have been brewing since the toilet roll task. Still a great episode and I'm looking forward to the next one as always."
22,ooimhz_00023,Matt's movie was one of the funniest things I've ever seen from this show. Grunge Man had me howling.
23,ooimhz_00024,Laura would fit right into r/newzealand complaining about how old people own all the houses.
24,ooimhz_00025,"Right when I was starting to warm up to Matt, he goes Full Gorman and starts cheating. I need to watch the episode again to get a better sense of how I feel about it."
25,ooimhz_00026,How is it possible that Matt got more scotch in the bucket than Guy? It looked like there was a lot more spillage
26,ooimhz_00027,"I would have bought in tapes of ""unauthorised history of NZ"" that I illegaly burned off youtube. Bag of Feijoas still better though"
27,ooimhz_00028,"Scotch task, David self sabotages again!"
28,ooimhz_00029,Part 1 thoughts: Jeremy breaking the illusion a bit with his intro but in itself quite new zealand given the prize task. Weakest prize task of the season so far. Hence not long was spent on it. Laura and Guys short films were very strong. Was right in Laura's wheel House as she's done that kind of thing before on other TV shows.
29,ooimhz_00030,Food tasks make me miss Maria Stavang.
30,ooimhz_00031,
31,ooimhz_00032,"Is ""carbo-loading"" (as opposed to ""carb-loading"") an Americanism, or just a thing my dad says?"
32,ooimhz_00033,"Matt 100% didn't cheat. There's no rule saying you can't pocket the Weetabix. (PS. Also, as an Englishman who lives in Australia, I can confirm that antipodeans do call them 'Weet-Bix'. It's weird.)"
0,otx5c4_00001,Sorry it's so late I was in vacation and out slipped my mind.
1,otx5c4_00002,"I would have loved to ask you guys about the series, but the rule ""We don't tolerate any sexism or bigotry of any kind towards contestants or users."" without you spelling out what that entails obviously makes that impossible."
2,otx5c4_00003,"That wasn't a real victoria cross that Guy bought in surely? Like nobody commented on it being fake but it can't be real- that's a very valuable item. Also prize tasks where they try are so much better- Daisy would have just been like ""I stole this pen""."
3,otx5c4_00004,Nothing or Onions is up there with Horse or Laminator for all time great studio tasks
4,otx5c4_00005,One thing I'd say is I didn't expect that I'd like Guy this much back in episode one. That man is funny. I absolutely love good character act all his jokes work sooo well me that they floor me everytime.
5,otx5c4_00006,Laura's prize task has to be up there in the top 10 prize task 'items'.
6,otx5c4_00007,"Laura's prize task, especially the slow build nature of it, should have instantly won her the episode. Genius planning, genius execution, and the solidarity with Urzila was the cherry on the sundae. Amazing."
7,otx5c4_00008,"The chocolate fish task is just perfect. The right mix of strategy, skill, absurdity, and comedy. Alex Horne must have been spewing when the NZ crew ran it by him."
8,otx5c4_00009,"I just want David Correos to absolutely smash a task and ascend to the status of taskmaster legend. He's clearly not going to win, but he is definitely enjoying himself and is super positive about everyone (aggressively shouting how proud he was of Laura for the hanging bucket was a particular favourite). I can only aspire to that level of positive energy"
9,otx5c4_00010,I love the occasional Taskmaster UK easter eggs; I was nearly as excited as Kerry Godliman by the appearance of the laminator.
10,otx5c4_00011,David coming in with the list of facts for the tree frog was brilliant.
11,otx5c4_00012,"I know it's pointless to compare Greg and Jeremy at this point, but there's no way on earth that Greg would have allowed Urzila to give her points to Matt!"
12,otx5c4_00013,"The first time they cut to an ad break and I saw the fish poster in the shid, I quite literally squealed out loud in glee."
13,otx5c4_00014,"For Laura to dominate the prize task and then write that song, LEGEND"
14,otx5c4_00015,"🎶 if jesus was here, we’d have a three way...I wanna laminate this calendar day 🎶"
15,otx5c4_00016,Brilliant prize task from Laura. I wish she'd stolen Urzulas wife as well but I think she likes to keep her relationship private so can let it off.
16,otx5c4_00017,"The song task has to be one of the best tasks to be executed in Taskmaster history. Tbh outside of Ursila (and matt i guess), They were all done beautifully and even Ursilas one wasnt that bad. Truely showing the levels of genius and indivuduality of each contestant"
17,otx5c4_00018,Laura's GOAT status confirmed after this stellar ep. So fucking funny.
18,otx5c4_00019,"Episode 4 was legitimately one of the all time great Taskmaster episodes, from any country, any series. Just wish Jeremy would get more animated / involved!"
19,otx5c4_00020,This series might be my favourite series of all time
20,otx5c4_00021,"After weeks of binging the entirety of Taskmaster, both the UK and New Zealand versions, this is the first episode I watched as live. And what an episode to catch up on."
21,otx5c4_00022,"The live task is essentially the same as the the ""stand behind a curtain"" one from our S11, but much more entertaining."
22,otx5c4_00023,"""Laminate that calendar date"" was brilliant. Really really clever tasks. And yet, the episode somehow didn't quite do it for me the way the others have."
23,otx5c4_00024,Great prize task probably one of the best. Really solid episode all around.
24,otx5c4_00025,I feel betrayed. I thought Paul was gay 😫
25,otx5c4_00026,Hahaha Jerry brought up Starlight Macintosh. It's been a running joke from the radio show for years. Just waiting for him to start calling him Leslie (Jerry recently found out its Matts birthname)
26,otx5c4_00027,Alternative episode title: Let's Try Positive Thinking.
27,otx5c4_00028,Guy’s dad and the festive fox...OMG.
28,otx5c4_00029,
29,otx5c4_00030,"Jeremy: ""ung-yung"""
30,otx5c4_00031,"One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that the polite audience laughter to Jeremy's opening monologue seemed like canned laughter. I don't know if it is or not, but it sounded like it. Is it just me? Nothing else in the episode or any previous episode sounded that artificial. Shocked to hear that David Correos was an athlete of that level. I presume he's past his competitive days and not in Japan right now. New Zealand reference I need help with. In the beginning they referred to the trophy as created by ""a much cheaper West Auckland equivalent of Weta Workshop"". What is that exactly? I would put an Otter as more powerful than a Red Eyed Tree Frog."
0,oxkza5_00001,the beans task is already a CLASSIC let me say
1,oxkza5_00002,Great episode. I like how Jeremy is really making the role his own and praising the Taskmasters Assistant rather than bullying him. I can’t believe we didn’t have contestants looking under the table unmediated during the beans task. I totally expected there to be some marker on the bottom of the beans can.
2,oxkza5_00003,Jeremy telling Matt that he isn't even from Dunedin was one of the funniest moments of any media I've ever seen.
3,oxkza5_00004,
4,oxkza5_00005,How come Urzila didn't talk about Bunny Park?!
5,oxkza5_00006,"Hahaha, oh dear David. So unlucky with the bean cans. And Matt sitting there talking so that he didn't win the bean task :P"
6,oxkza5_00007,"""It looked loud"" - killer line"
7,oxkza5_00008,ESEELC NHOJ ETANIMILE
8,oxkza5_00009,"I disagree with Jeremy's scoring; I am unreasonably proud of David for showcasing our bus exchange and malls. Despite this, 'twas a very good episode."
9,oxkza5_00010,"OK, the beans task is evil bastard genius, and definitely one I'd love to have seen on the UK show."
10,oxkza5_00011,"The beans task was good but it does show one of the things the UK show is a lot better at -- the editing. In the UK show when they have these reveals it's always cleverly revealed through an amusing edit. Often juxtaposing it with someone wondering if there was a trick, that kind of thing. Here they just showed it straight away, you can see it during the open montage bit. Still a good task but I think it's more fun when it's a surprise to the audience too It was funny that Laura was the only one to spot the arrow and still came last"
11,oxkza5_00012,David’s a fine fellow but the sight of him staring at Paul intently whilst stabbing a succession of tomato cans with a kitchen knife was quite chilling. And then he gets the sword later. Maybe don’t give him sharp objects?
12,oxkza5_00013,The amount of cans David got through was incredible. So unlucky.
13,oxkza5_00014,Lots of NZ specific jokes in this one- good luck foreigners.
14,oxkza5_00015,5 different winners in 5 episodes...has to be a record
15,oxkza5_00016,David was a bit hard done by in the live task...doesn't really matter what cutting tool you pick if you're left with a cauliflower. The order they had to go in was the biggest factor I think
16,oxkza5_00017,Oh no Matt…Every St is probably not the best reference in your hometown song!
17,oxkza5_00018,"A good episode, but felt like a bit of a step down from the near perfect last couple of episodes. Beans task was the clear highlight, classic frustrating TM. I like that David can't stop himself from screaming even during a task where he has to stay silent. The live task was scored really badly. As someone else noted, it should have been scored by percentages to make it fair, which is how they ended up just going in order of who picked which snack first."
18,oxkza5_00019,Can't believe we're already halfway through this season. Here's hoping UK series 12 premieres soon
19,oxkza5_00020,"Had to do a lot of research in this episode as a non-Kiwi but I enjoyed the hell out of it, this series hasn’t had a dud episode yet IMO. Laura’s video was incredible, and Urzila’s sheer joy at winning the episode (and the ~prizes~) was infectious. I’m so sad we’re at the halfway point already, I don’t want this series to end!"
20,oxkza5_00021,David continues to be hilariously robbed
21,oxkza5_00022,"The banter in the prize tasks has been fucking hilarious. All the contestants play off each other so well, and Jeremy got some pretty great jabs in."
22,oxkza5_00023,I have to imagine that there were many dubious tomato based dishes served at Taskmaster NZ cafeteria during filming.
23,oxkza5_00024,"This episode made me nostalgic for Palmerston North. Used to live there for 5 years. So yeah, I agree with Laura David about John Cleese"
24,oxkza5_00025,David is my new hero after the bean task
25,oxkza5_00026,"Pretty decent episode, I enjoyed the bean task the most but the important thing was that all the tasks seemed very original, even the noise one, which is the strength of this series. Nice for everyone to have won an episode so early on - keeps the suspense up for those who care about the winner. The teams are really good - the team of three are like some sort of 00s Disney Channel show friends while the team of two are really good together. It helps that everyone likes eachothers' company."
26,oxkza5_00027,"This episode was brilliant, actually, the whole season. And the bean task was incredibly clever."
27,oxkza5_00028,The bean task put such a huge stupid smile on my face.
28,oxkza5_00029,"Great ep, a whole lot of NZ references. Beans task is a classic. Really enjoying David. Only thing I would have changed is the second half of the live task to be revealed post item selection. Or maybe I just want David to win too much."
29,oxkza5_00030,
30,oxkza5_00031,Solid prize task. Bean task looks like a classic. If I remember correctly its first time TMNZ has done the answer in the environment?
31,oxkza5_00032,Aerial view Hats off to the fire department's handling of the infamous scrub fire of 2015
32,oxkza5_00033,"Jeremy didn't bring it up but is Mosgiel actually part of Dunedin? Bunch of hills in the way, I feel like its culturally a seperate little town."
33,oxkza5_00034,
0,p2hafi_00001,"Matt saying he hoped the other team would be respectful in the rap, only for the editing to cut to a shot of David saying ""fuck you Matt heath"" was comedic gold. One of the best tasks in TM history."
1,p2hafi_00002,"Oh man. Maori/English Treaty of Waitangi was such a great gambit Also IDK why but The Three Friends' (especially Guy's) rap just reminded me of this Also, so many hilarious lines"
2,p2hafi_00003,"Easily one of my funniest episodes of taskmaster. Does track and Abraham had me crying with laughter. The intensity of David getting more and more into it was hilarious. Started with mocking teeth, then moved on to running over a cat, then drowning in blood. Brilliant"
3,p2hafi_00004,"As much as David’s diss rap killed me, I choked when they were discussing if fictional characters were celebrities in the final task, and David asked Jeremy how much he knew about Yu-Gi-Oh."
4,p2hafi_00005,Laura Daniels looked more like Ibrahim Lincoln than Abraham Lincoln
5,p2hafi_00006,Matt aggressively threatening to eat ass was great Also I was surprised that Laura and David actually rap pretty well (the other 3 do not)
6,p2hafi_00007,"One of the best Taskmaster episodes ever. Prize and studio tasks were great but the three main tasks, I burst out laughing during each one. Absolutely brilliant."
7,p2hafi_00008,"David is fucking untethered. I have never seen another contestant like him on any version of Taskmaster. The contrast between Matt struggling to insult Guy and David rapping ""I'm gonna drown you in your own blood"" is something else. Every episode usually has a ""contains coarse language"" warning, but this week's disclaimer said ""contains frequent use of coarse language and scenes that may disturb some people,"" and I'm 100% certain that's all David's doing."
8,p2hafi_00009,Everyone here is talking about the rap battle while I’m impressed with David’s alpha move to pick Joaquin Phoenix to start the name game.
9,p2hafi_00010,"""Montgomery, more like Montgoobery"" cutting to ♫ I'M GONNA GONNA GONNA DROWN YOU. IN YOUR OWN BLOOD. HOLD YOUR FACE DOWN. IN YOUR OWN BLOOD NOW. ♫ was some inspired editing. 5 points to the producers for adding the backing track too. I want to make all of David's little catchy yet vitriolic raps into ring tones. 😂"
10,p2hafi_00011,"What an amazing episode. Prize task was great and I really like how TMNZ leaves space for the contestants to attack each other. I liked the parachute/rocking chair task and how they all fucked it up in their own way... I think the scoring was quite good on that one. To give them points on how many items they got of in the ""correct way"", instead of just disqualifying everyone for breaking the rules. The diss track task was brilliant. It was so much fun to see sweet fluffy David go completely mental and his apology at the end was cute. The songs were really funny and I think the reaction of the other team in the studio was good. They all took it so well. Concerning the phone task, I personally think it is great that TMNZ is unafraid to try new stuff and the call was just hilarious with everyone turning in. Good thinking from Urzila with the ghost! However, I think for the scoring they should have taken the costume into account as well. The live task was pretty fun again. I tried the whole time to come up with celebrities as well, it is quite hard for some letters actually..."
11,p2hafi_00012,Never in a hundred years would I hear Matt Heath threaten to eat Guy Montgomery's ass. Yet here we are. Fantastic episode
12,p2hafi_00013,David Correos. OMFG. That diss rap track was legit bananas. Stomping the floor so hard to psych himself up he dislodged his glasses off. Likely the most unhinged moment on any episode of taskmaster.
13,p2hafi_00014,"I never thought someone would show up with a sheet to be the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, that was hilarious."
14,p2hafi_00015,I'm gonna put myself out there: the burner phone task is one of the best tasks in the history of Taskmaster UK+NZ.
15,p2hafi_00016,The diss track task is probably my favourite so far this series - the cut between the group of two’s writing progress and David’s OTT freestyles is just perfect
16,p2hafi_00017,"I'm without doubt head over heels for whoever is designing the tasks in taskmaster NZ. I kind of get when some people say that it being new allows it to get away with stuff but, the phone task and the prize task were so novel that they could have gone down just as well in TM UK. Alex needs to up his game. Really looking forward to series 12 to see if they've taken any sort of inspiration."
17,p2hafi_00018,This episode answers the question people ask about how the taskmasters compare in the UK and NZ. They're as different as a cinder block and custard.
18,p2hafi_00019,"Abe Lincoln Zoom task was wonderful and entirely different to anything I've seen on Taskmaster before, brilliant stuff."
19,p2hafi_00020,I really enjoy Guy Montgomery. He's goofy and awkward but delivers some genuinely good task moments as well as some disasters. I don't know him outside of this show but I'm gonna start looking into his stuff.
20,p2hafi_00021,i really think the tasks for nz taskmaster are currently better than the uk tasks. it's always going to miss greg and alex but nz taskmaster is on par with uk taskmaster imo.
21,p2hafi_00022,"Could you imagine having Mel from S4 having to do the rap task and still how nice her ""insults"" would have to be ?!"
22,p2hafi_00023,I really want to hear more of David's warm up raps. No thoughts just violence
23,p2hafi_00024,"What a great episode. This is one of the greatest Taskmaster series full stop. David's rap persona was genuinely terrifying. I wouldn't want to mess with him if he was on the mic. The burner phone task was brilliant, and the twist that Guy and David had just had lunch and went to the same shop was unbelievably good. Cried with laughter throughout this episode."
24,p2hafi_00025,Words can't express how much I enjoyed David getting more aggressive + everyone's reactions ... And the gathering of the Abraham Lincolns was just wholesome!
25,p2hafi_00026,"I never disliked him, but I think David might now be my favorite contestant of all time."
26,p2hafi_00027,"As good as Davids Rapping was, nothing broke me more than the disdain that Guy had when he said ""Yung lean, hes a rapper and hes 10x more famous Ronald fuckin Weasley."""
27,p2hafi_00028,"Wonderful episode. Laura absolutely KILLS every song challenge (and many others). Girl’s got serious talent. That Diss Track task! 😂😂😂 Guy was Ok, correos was crazy, but Laura’s bits alone ELEVATED their diss track big time. Also it’s always awesome seeing Correos absolutely losing his mind with laughter in studio, his laughter after Urzila and Mark’s diss track was the craziest by him I’ve seen yet. Umbrella item evacuation task was a bit anticlimactic. Kept expecting someone to come up with some sort of super creative solution but...nope."
28,p2hafi_00029,"On Matt and Jerry's radio show this morning, Jerry regrets giving matt and urzilla 2 points for their rap. Watching it back it was ""just terrible"""
29,p2hafi_00030,"That was such a strong episode! So much of it was carried by the contestants and their in-studio interactions in a way that I don't think we've ever quite seen on the UK version. Plus, I never thought I'd laugh so much at the phrase ""I love slavery!"" being uttered, but here we are."
30,p2hafi_00031,"I knew David was crazy, but... damn... (I can't stop singing it... GONNA DROWN YOU IN YOUR OWN BLOOD Help me)"
31,p2hafi_00032,"This is one of the greatest taskmaster episodes/casts I've seen. I was laughing tears the entire diss track task, David is off the fucking chain. He, Laura, and Guy are definitely on my radar to watch out for in other stuff."
32,p2hafi_00033,"Cracker episode. The diss track task and the phone task were both genius, had my cheeks aching from laughing so much. This will probably end up being my fave series out of all the TM versions, after UK s7."
33,p2hafi_00034,"Wow. That was just a super fucking episode from start to fucking finish. Outstanding work by everyone. Three questions though: Where did that anger come from, David? It was amazing Who knew Laura could spit rhymes like that? Was Laura drunk and/or high in the studio? The entire first half of the episode she was quite clearly in some sort of altered state."
34,p2hafi_00035,"I gotta hand it to David for being able to express such toxic rage without being obnoxious or overbearing, while also still being hilarious. That is not something you would see on the American taskmaster."
35,p2hafi_00036,Very excited to keep rewatching the diss track task once a day for the rest of my life. Also the pure joy I felt watching the Abe Lincoln video call will never be replicated.
36,p2hafi_00037,"This season would be great even without David. A season entirely carried by David would be great. Mathematically this makes this season great squared. Great episode, great season. I think what is really strong about this season is all the contestants are really getting to show their personality in every task and in the studio."
37,p2hafi_00038,That diss track challenge might be the hardest I’ve ever laughed at any Taskmaster task. Loving this series!
38,p2hafi_00039,Sorry but that rap battle was absolute legendary Taskmaster. I’m done. They won TV with that.
39,p2hafi_00040,Great episode. Love them attacking eachother in prize task. Damn Matt had Peter Plumley Walker locked and loaded no matter what the letter was. Probably didn't care for the task trying to get a laugh out of Jerry. For those that don't know he was a cricket umpire killed by a prostitute in the 80s. Matt and Jerry (and Leigh from s1) have talked about him extensively in their cricket commentary
40,p2hafi_00041,I saw the bucket hanging when Laura was walking out to do the parachute task!
41,p2hafi_00042,"Can we also discuss the fact that in the phone task, Guy was laughing in character as Abe Lincoln? I was dying."
42,p2hafi_00043,"Couldn't stop laughing at Guy's ""if you play your cards right we could have a new idiom on our hands"" comment"
43,p2hafi_00044,"The only complaint I have about this episode is Laura scoring 1 point in the prize tasks, it was hilarious and well thought out imo."
44,p2hafi_00045,"I have a theory that Episode 6 is the best episode of any given series. It's been true for the UK series 10 and 11, and for both NZ series. I'm gonna kill both of you!"
45,p2hafi_00046,Old Dirty David Correos newest member of Wu Tang.
46,p2hafi_00047,"I was least taken with Matt Heath at the start of the series, but he has really grown on me with the constant misunderstandings. All he needed was a letter B, so close and yet so far."
47,p2hafi_00048,"The diss track task instantly became an all-time fave. It also had me thinking, what if we got this task during one of the past UK series? Imagine Mike and Lee or Mel and Hugh trying to write a rap…"
48,p2hafi_00049,"David's sheer intensity was fantastic, this episode was amazing. I'm loving the New Zealand take on Taskmaster ‐ it's as good as the original!"
49,p2hafi_00050,"Damn, Correos went off on that one."
50,p2hafi_00051,"I very rarely spot the good solution so I'm quite pleased with this one: In the 'take all the things off the parachute' task, you can move the chair to the grass on the edge of the mat, then sit down and pick up the parachute."
51,p2hafi_00052,David's rap was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. That rage seemed so genuine lol.
52,p2hafi_00053,Fuck me the Rap task will go in my best of all time TM. Fuck man So good David
53,p2hafi_00054,"I held it in all episode long so as not to wake up my son, but “Yellow!” finally broke me. God, what an episode."
54,p2hafi_00055,That diss track task may be one of my favourites ever. i loved the juxtaposition of the teams preparing.
55,p2hafi_00056,
56,p2hafi_00057,"People from New Zealand, do you guys really eat chalk on the regular?"
57,p2hafi_00058,So many of the tasks this series end with someone collapsed on the ground.
58,p2hafi_00059,"""Shit man"" Matt Heath sounded like a bullied character in the Simpsons there"
59,p2hafi_00060,Really don't know why Laura got 5 points when the task said to look and act like Abe Lincoln and she did neither. It always feels like so much discussion is cut out of these episodes because the other contestants must've said something about it...we need extended episodes for all the cut studio moments.
60,p2hafi_00061,"Why was Urzila calling David a ""wifi guy?"""
61,p2hafi_00062,Dis track task was epic
62,p2hafi_00063,"Loved the first two tasks, I'm going to be unpopular and say the phone task was my least favourite of the series so far. Very good episode, I think it's a two horse race for the title now."
63,p2hafi_00064,I could not understand what the item was in the item task. It was tofu and what? Does anyone know?
64,p2hafi_00065,
0,p6lf2o_00001,Caravan task only slightly below Rosalind right now Edit: Teabat!
1,p6lf2o_00002,Matt Heath being proud of occasionally overcoming the middle age crisis is underrated.
2,p6lf2o_00003,"Jesus christ this season is good. Although the live task was mishandled, I think. It was a good basic idea, but it ended up just being a 50/50 coin toss each time. All the little rules were meaningless"
3,p6lf2o_00004,David has now made me laugh harder than any contestant on any TM ... twice.
4,p6lf2o_00005,"My love for Guy knows no bounds. He just has such a different vibe, like an incredibly lovable chill guy who will also bake an I Fucked Your Dad cake or write a song about your Dad having sex with a fox."
5,p6lf2o_00006,
6,p6lf2o_00007,"Incredible that David strung himself up like a flailing bat to serve tea, and that’s not even close to the most notable thing about the episode. Iconic. he said on his Twitter that the show hasn’t reached the most unhinged moments yet. the depths of his chaotic energy cannot be contained."
7,p6lf2o_00008,"""I fucked your dad"""
8,p6lf2o_00009,"David's reactions as they're watching the caravan escape room task make me think he's really fucked it up. EDIT: Oh, David..."
9,p6lf2o_00010,"Not where I thought the series was going, but I officially love Matt. Full-on forgetting what the task was by the time he got out of the caravan. This task so good, Jeremy wasn't even trying to keep a straight face. Also the moral of the story is always carry $20, to buy pie."
10,p6lf2o_00011,"""You've got a thick dick, Paul"" knocked me out"
11,p6lf2o_00012,"So far, both seasons of Taskmaster NZ have had: A guy named Guy A contestant asking Paul to perform a sexual act Paul doing a pole dance A contestant getting naked This show is certainly consistent."
12,p6lf2o_00013,The Grape task may be one of the best if not the best taskmaster task in the history of taskmaster
13,p6lf2o_00014,"""I don't like this episode"" Sorry, Paul, I must disagree. Even Jeremy was hilarious in the live task."
14,p6lf2o_00015,This is all going by much too quickly.
15,p6lf2o_00016,"This is easily one of the best seasons of any version of Taskmaster along with UK Seasons 7 and 11, easy. Guy Montgomery is tremendously witty and quick with a quip, and David Correos is perhaps one of the best Taskmaster contestants in any season of any version of the show."
16,p6lf2o_00017,The $9.90 was genius... Missing the 10c in the sofa.
17,p6lf2o_00018,"This was brilliant! At first I thought the caravan task might be too convoluted but the complete inadequacy of the contestants made it. It was great seeing Matt and David react to the way Laura and Guy completed it, you just knew they were gonna be shit. Plus the lemonade roulette, made even better by the fact I'd just watched seven sharp (Hilary Barry is Jeremy's co host on this show). And the wedding cakes and bat tea. Yep Taskmaster NZ has certainly brightened up my lockdown."
18,p6lf2o_00019,"David's reaction in the studio when Laura and Guy were doing the caravan task was hilarious. Feel like that's one of the tasks that could have ended up like the locker task from S10, where it ended up being boring cos there was no room for creativity, however the strength of this line up, and the way in which the task was edited, did not allow that to happen and it was definitely the stand out task in this episode."
19,p6lf2o_00020,"Amazing. It was a 50/50 choice and every single one chose wrong. What are the odds? If my maths is right, like 4%?"
20,p6lf2o_00021,"I've watched this a couple of times now, out of trying to understand why I love this so much. For years I've been watching Brits do comedy, and compared to the Americans, they seem so self-deprecating and down-to-earth. But there's still this whole vibe of wanting to be the centre of attention that makes them feel a bit uppity at times. Like, they try hard to be the most self-deprecating. Not all of them, for course, but some of them. This leads to some extra competitiveness in Taskmaster that isn't always that fun to watch. In fact, the best contestants to my taste were Mel Giedroyc and Mike Wozniak for being super wholesome. And the most comfy seasons were the ones where they all felt like friends and not competitors. Watching TM NZ is really a breath of fresh air. The David/Guy/Paul trio this season in particular is so much fun to watch during the studio, they always seem to be at the brink of bursting out laughing earnestly, in a way that neither the Brits nor the Yanks really do. It's soul-cleansing. The disarming accent also contributes a ton to this."
21,p6lf2o_00022,The Caravan task is simultaneously the best and worst I've ever seen a consistent do a task.
22,p6lf2o_00023,Laura has Liza Tarbuck levels of competency. She's one of my favourite ever contestants. David will be remembered and immortalised for this series (correctly) but Laura is a ray of sunshine. My favourite contests never usually win but im in with a chance this time 😁
23,p6lf2o_00024,For those that don't know; Briscoes is a shop in NZ famous for having sales every weekend
24,p6lf2o_00025,This caravan challenge is amazing. And David just making noise in studio and his attempt isn't shown yet
25,p6lf2o_00026,
26,p6lf2o_00027,"What a great episode... I think most things were already mentioned by other people, but I just wanted to point on thing out: Jeremy looks absolutely adorable in a yellow rain jacket"
27,p6lf2o_00028,So today we learned that Paul is not as keen as Alex to have cake inside him
28,p6lf2o_00029,"i feel like this episode, Jeremy was explaining his reasoning for points way more compared to previous episodes. its like someone read all the reddit feedback to him"
29,p6lf2o_00030,"""Paul, is that your key company?"" David 😭😭 This was SUCH a good episode, everyone was adorable. Matt's grown on me so much. Loved how much we got to see of Paul in all his assistant aswell as breaking character glory. And Urzila's mad eyes and sheer delight after that groan from Paul xD"
30,p6lf2o_00031,"This season has been such a banger, and the contestants are all really good and have some of the best chemistry I've seen between this and the UK. That grape task will definitely be a Taskmaster NZ hall of fame task."
31,p6lf2o_00032,That was really really great. David's caravan breakdown is a Taskmaster great of all time
32,p6lf2o_00033,When you watch a episode and switch straight over to the (Tv2+1) hour delayed channel you know its good
33,p6lf2o_00034,Every minute of this series has been SUPREME
34,p6lf2o_00035,You don’t cut the cake ‘til after the ceremony’s done. They’re LEGALLY BOUND.
35,p6lf2o_00036,Hahahahaha this cast is amazing. David and the caravan had me laughing so hard I was crying 😂
36,p6lf2o_00037,I think at this point this season is my favourite of any season of any taskmaster
37,p6lf2o_00038,
38,p6lf2o_00039,I’m pretty sure both TM NZ series would get into my top 5 overall.
39,p6lf2o_00040,"When Laura dropped the title, oh my god"
40,p6lf2o_00041,"I would have at least ASKED Paul if he could bring the grape to the window. I don't know how that would have played out in the studio, though... I'd feel lousy finishing that way. And then: ""Why hasn't he been in studio for the past six episodes? Well, he's still locked in the caravan because he never found the key."""
41,p6lf2o_00042,Maybe it's just because I'm a very small person but I'm surprised that no one tried to climb out of the window of the caravan.
42,p6lf2o_00043,"Good episode but wish they had shuffled the tasks around- make a crazy cake, make a crazy cup of tea too similar for me."
43,p6lf2o_00044,The grape task was amazing. I loved that it was like a escape room
44,p6lf2o_00045,Series 2 has been a banger so far. I'm so excited to see what they come up week after week. Highlight is definitely this cast. One of the more solid casts in terms of dynamics and how they play off of each other.
45,p6lf2o_00046,I kept forgetting that the series had started and finally binged the first six episodes this past weekend. If it finishes strong (and I can't imagine it won't) this'll be right up there with UK S5 and S7 as personal favorites.
46,p6lf2o_00047,I've laughed out loud more at this season than any other.
47,p6lf2o_00048,"Was there any rule against asking the audience which bottle Jeremy shook? Also, is this the first time Jeremy has taken part in a live task? Always enjoy the rare occasions when Greg does"
48,p6lf2o_00049,"So we have a competitor for the original Woznoise, and from the assistant himself!"
49,p6lf2o_00050,In separate conversations I've heard Jeremy called the DILF of NZ and Hillary Barry the MILF of NZ. So seeing they host together too this part of the live task absolutely killed me
50,p6lf2o_00051,Was that Angella's boilersuit making a cameo in the cake task?
51,p6lf2o_00052,Has the taskmaster even been part of a task before????!!!!!!!!
52,p6lf2o_00053,"Can we have serious discussion now, how do you actually get lemonade points I thought maybe check if one is warmer or look for one that has condensation wiped off? I thought at least one of them would try to work it out without just reaching in straight away!"
53,p6lf2o_00054,is this the first time a task has not awarded any points at all? It's certainly the first stage task.
54,p6lf2o_00055,No bucket in tea task must have filmed this one before hand.
55,p6lf2o_00056,I thought Deja Voodoo was a fake band from Back of the Y. Did they actually release music or this whole thing a high concept joke?
56,p6lf2o_00057,"I’m crying so hard from that task. From David’s studio reactions I knew it was going to be good, but omg."
57,p6lf2o_00058,I really thought someone would use something related to the old Warehouse jingles for the prize task. Urzila's Briscoes card was good though.
58,p6lf2o_00059,Anyone else's first thought for the tea task be magic mushroom tea? Or just me?
59,p6lf2o_00060,
0,pb1yd4_00001,
1,pb1yd4_00002,When it did 10 minutes earlier I thought maybe Laura had time traveled to another task to give herself advice.
2,pb1yd4_00003,"This is one of my all time favorite episodes of all of Taskmaster. I love the dialogue between Ursula and Paul, and Guy’s subtle one-liners. Jeremy is really growing on me."
3,pb1yd4_00004,I can't get over how much Urzila looks like a plus size Roisin and I love it
4,pb1yd4_00005,that has to be one of my favourite ever live tasks almost purely because of david
5,pb1yd4_00006,"What is ""Spot"", Matt's nostalgia inducing prize? It looks like drug paraphernalia."
6,pb1yd4_00007,Laura being a sneaky pasta snake was incredible. David pulling Guy closer to him and away from Laura was glorious.
7,pb1yd4_00008,Guy throwing Paul that double onion and saying “I know you don’t like onions by themselves” was quite possibly the best throwaway joke ever on Taskmaster.
8,pb1yd4_00009,"""David wouldn't, but Guy definitely would"""
9,pb1yd4_00010,Urzila's time travel was her best appearance of the season for me. That was just an absolute delight and she was robbed.
10,pb1yd4_00011,Matt Heath's roman costume might be a Taskmaster costumes hall of famer
11,pb1yd4_00012,"Anyone else happily notice that Jeremy (perhaps of his own accord, perhaps having been instructed to do so) really made a lot more efforts to provide commentary, make notes, comment on stuff in tasks, etc, rather than just robotically scoring and moving on? YAY! The kinks are being ironed out! Viva la Taskmaster New Zealand!"
12,pb1yd4_00013,"Davis is just absolutely fucking magnificent. His onion tower was proper tragedy, doing an absolute bang up job with a story that fit exactly what was going on in his building, down to changing for someone else being a mistake which manifested in his clearly superior tower crumbling at the last, to his genuine hurt by the Laura reveal and then that studio task which I absolutely lost my shit of over. WHY WAS HE LEANING THE BOARD OVER ON HIMSELF? HOW DID HE BREAK TWO PENS? His energy and chaos level is absolutely legendary. I am an absolute, absolute fan. Just amazing."
13,pb1yd4_00014,"The strength of the New Zealand show is that it is more light hearted and wholesome than most of the British series, but man I would’ve loved to see one of the competitive and dysfunctional casts handle that sabotage task."
14,pb1yd4_00015,"Oh man, I loved that Paul's face went missing from Guy's shirt when he came back to the present xD"
15,pb1yd4_00016,"Holy shit, that sabotage task was perfect. And Urzila should've gotten the 5 points for the time travel task. Another stellar episode."
16,pb1yd4_00017,OMG this is the best blindside ever!
17,pb1yd4_00018,Nothing will ever make me laugh at this episode than Paul trying to convince Laura to sabotage her team Edit: Guy and David's reaction to the sabotage and winning both made me giggle as well
18,pb1yd4_00019,"I only figured out what Spots were from remembering the Peep Show episode where they mention hot knifing. Sabotage task was a classic, amazed that's never cropped up before in previous seasons. I feel very protective of David and his frequent shouting, terrible luck, and extreme guilt whenever he is insulting towards somebody. Guy is still my favourite. Him killing Hitler only cemented that fact."
19,pb1yd4_00020,Anyone fancy a key? http://paulskeyemporium.co.nz
20,pb1yd4_00021,
21,pb1yd4_00022,I've not been a fan of Jeremy Wells in his role - but this episode is where that changes. Looks like he's finally figured it out. Fantastic episode by the Taskmaster!
22,pb1yd4_00023,I liked Matt's attempt at 'time travel' because it was also my first thought but the Roman costume was a great added touch. Urzila or Laura should've won though! Also thought Matt was referring to harder drugs than weed and everyone just rolled with it. Love coming to this thread and actually having the NZ cultural references explained :') David's confidence in winning then absolute cockup when it came to the onions and stage task ended me. 10/10 Taskmaster contestant.
23,pb1yd4_00024,David is maybe the only guy in the world I would believe if he genuinely apologized after killing my whole family
24,pb1yd4_00025,"Was busy last night so just watched it myself. Another solid ep. For Non-NZers: Spots - Way to smoke week Richard Hadlee - Legendary NZ Cricket player from the 80s, first person to take 400 test wickets Suzy Cato - Childrens entertainer from the 90s, national icon Trade Me - NZ version of Ebay"
25,pb1yd4_00026,"I couldn't be the only one wondering what a ""Seagar"" was prior to them putting a picture of a Sega up."
26,pb1yd4_00027,The idea to add a saboteur to the team tasks is a genius idea to counterbalance the fact that one team has one more person for the task. I really wish they permanently add this idea to the uk one as well. Overall I am surprised that all the tasks are so funny and original without copying any tasks from the 12 seasons of the uk one. Even the prize tasks are great.
27,pb1yd4_00028,Paul is straight up dreamy
28,pb1yd4_00029,"I really liked this episode. The balloon betrayal task was wonderfully funny, as was the brief splitting of The Three Friends. David's self portrait carving was on a par with some things I've seen in art galleries."
29,pb1yd4_00030,Jeremy was really good this episode! They're taking feedback and making the show better!
30,pb1yd4_00031,"I missed it the first time around but with headphones, you can really hear the constant gasping of David during Laura's sabotaging. It elevated the shenanigans."
31,pb1yd4_00032,"For the balloon sabotage, I would have got in the caravan and locked the door, and played off the locking like it must be a hidden twist in the task."
32,pb1yd4_00033,"Suzy Cato in her glasses for reference. Essentially Suzy is a taonga (national treasure). I'm in my 30s, yet I can still use ""'my dad worked on You and Me"" as a bragging move."
33,pb1yd4_00034,Jesus Christ do I need that Ask a Kiwi guy after this prize task
34,pb1yd4_00035,"I couldn't find a moment from Episode 1, but other than that, one screaming/collapsed moment from David from every episode. https://imgur.com/a/ZHjdT7h"
35,pb1yd4_00036,So maybe I am real uncool (or too young?) but I'm from New Zealand and have no idea what matt's prize was.
36,pb1yd4_00037,This episode was so good. I didn't really like Laura the first couple episodes but she has VERY quickly shot up to my favorite. She's been on fire lately. She's so great.
37,pb1yd4_00038,TIL New Zealanders smoke their cannabis like it’s heroin.
38,pb1yd4_00039,I'm really scared of the prospect of David slipping into last place.
39,pb1yd4_00040,Anyone else think there was something to help them with the onions located in the bathtub? I'm surprised no one started digging through it!
40,pb1yd4_00041,I do wonder if they based the sabotage on Rhod Gilbert and the extension task! Another superb twist though!
41,pb1yd4_00042,Loved it! PLEASE DON’T BE OVER IN 2 WEEKS!
42,pb1yd4_00043,Love to see Taskmaster NZ low-key trying to reboot 'The Mole'
43,pb1yd4_00044,the sabotage task added a bit of Eastenders level of drama to the team task
44,pb1yd4_00045,"The time travel task was real - The https://www.kiwitapemeasurers.co.nz/ website is from the future!!!! Scroll down to the bottom. Also - the site prominently features a Stanley tape measure, which is an American company. Maybe they going to be bought by a kiwi billionaire in the next 2 years. I smell an investment opportunity!!! Or maybe someone will just trade a house in Wellington for the whole company."
45,pb1yd4_00046,Loved that episode from start to finish. Everyone was on peak form!
46,pb1yd4_00047,So curious if that sabotage task was in any way inspired by Among Us
47,pb1yd4_00048,Excellent. The sabotage task is great. What a surprise.
48,pb1yd4_00049,Dead at the spots taking second place prize
49,pb1yd4_00050,How to sabotage without obviously sabotaging
50,pb1yd4_00051,
51,pb1yd4_00052,"Fun episode, wasn't a fan of the time travel task (I rarely enjoy those kind of tasks) but every thing else was spot on. Laura's sabotage task was lovely, I was thinking ""How are they going to make this fair, there are 3 of them?"". I totally would have opened the car doors once I saw it getting full"
52,pb1yd4_00053,"I was so looking forward to Jeremy trying to say ""onions"" for a whole task. And then Matt Heath started trying to say ""onions."" I think we have discovered what binds them together."

0,pfmpp1_00001,Haha
1,pfmpp1_00002,"Guy Montgomery has comfortably earned his place in my top 5 contestants ever. He has the articulate loveability of Wozniak, the brash weirdness of Acaster, the commitment of Widdicombe, and the cheekiness of a year's worth of Mark Watson texts. However, I never want to see him wearing a tie for a thong ever again. Good lord, how can someone who lives in a country as hot as New Zealand be that pale?"
2,pfmpp1_00003,"Fun fact, the tattoo you can see on Guy during the tie task, is a tattoo of Patrick Schwarzenegger, Arnold Schwarzenegger's son."
3,pfmpp1_00004,These were some of the best tasks...so imaginative!
4,pfmpp1_00005,"I'm disappointed no one said ""my hands are tied""."
5,pfmpp1_00006,I have not liked Jeremy Wells so far but his deadpan shutdown on Laura at the end of the tie task is what I want to see. I'm all for that shit.
6,pfmpp1_00007,"Paul breaking during Guy's date really got me. I love the way Guy phrases stuff so much, even when you know the joke he's about to make he can still surprise you. This cast is such an incredible mix of personalities and comedy styles. They've absolutely nailed this series."
7,pfmpp1_00008,The national drink of France...the remnants of a piña colada.
8,pfmpp1_00009,Jeremy going to the ad break over Laura's indignant yelling has real big Josh Widdicombe angry about the counting energy.
9,pfmpp1_00010,"Laura's outrage at the scoring of the tie task, I was cracking up throughout the whole thing."
10,pfmpp1_00011,"The Guy and David synergy in the tie task is absolutely unparalleled, I spit out my coffee when Guy came in with the tie the exact color of the rest of his body. And props to Matt for finally understanding a few of the tasks, especially the orienteering one."
11,pfmpp1_00012,I'm really enjoying the nicer dynamic the taskmaster has with the assistant in this series. It has a bit of a longsuffering dad reluctantly indulges in the wacky shenanigans of his son kinda vibe.
12,pfmpp1_00013,"Matt Heath deserved that episode, was on fire"
13,pfmpp1_00014,"I am feeling so, so sad that this series is about to end. This series has had me constantly in hysterics and I'm at the point where I love the entire cast so much I genuinely don't care who wins. This week I had to pause several times during the date task and during the tie task because I was laughing so hard it was almost painful."

15,pfmpp1_00016,"Highlights: Christ almighty that was the clumsiest heist I've ever seen. And David laughing like a maniac at Matt wetting his finger to figure out where north is, proper gold. And bloody hell, Jeremy was fucking ruthless to Laura when he was judging the tie task. Fantastic stuff."
16,pfmpp1_00017,Paul breaking at the end of Guy's date made me almost cry laugh.
17,pfmpp1_00018,"Guy Montgomery is one of the wittiest quippers and I love it. Between last week's ""you can keep that. I know you don't like onions by themselves"" with the double onion, and this week's ""close your eyes. Imagine a strawberry. Now open them again,"" he's quickly becoming one of my all time favorite contestants."
18,pfmpp1_00019,I love giving them a faulty compass. It's just a little attention to detail that was basically guaranteed to cause some funny mayhem.
19,pfmpp1_00020,Urzula's continual bullying and harassment of Paul is one of the low key best parts of this series. And has there been a contestant who has nudes up as often as David?
20,pfmpp1_00021,David and Matt both putting their fingers in the air for north was priceless.
21,pfmpp1_00022,I think we now know why Matt's girl is a blow-up doll.
22,pfmpp1_00023,Taking Paul on a date task? Sounds like a Laura Daniel task as she has already stolen all the girlfriends!
23,pfmpp1_00024,matt kicking the shit out of paul as he went past was so funny. i don’t know how paul didnt even react
24,pfmpp1_00025,"Matt did uncharacteristically well this episode. It seemed like a strange role reversal between him and Laura and Guy. I though the date and orienteering tasks were the best. The juxtaposition between David and Matt's first date was wonderful, as was Urzila's sewer pond date."
25,pfmpp1_00026,Another fantastic episode! Spare a thought for the poor editor that had to carefully blur out David and Guy's junk.
26,pfmpp1_00027,"Until now, my favourite moment in the credits was always David's pathetic ""Ta-daaa"" when he revealed his painted tie - so I was surprised when they cut the audio of it in this episode, and then didn't have the ""Ta-daa"" in the task proper. Why tease something as funny as that and then not give it to us in context?"
27,pfmpp1_00028,"Best opening jokes from Jeremy ever. He is soooo much better now than in series 1, he’s really finding into his role. I like it 👍🏻 Brilliant episode, great tasks and cool category for the price task. Although it should have been obvious what David was to do in the tie task it did not occur to me and made me scream when he pulled down his pants 😱 🤣🤣"
28,pfmpp1_00029,"Matt's first date is just something else, especially the ""song"""
29,pfmpp1_00030,
30,pfmpp1_00031,The strawberry killed me. Absolutely hilarious task effort by Guy.
31,pfmpp1_00032,Paul Williams is a joy. All of them are a treat. This is top 3 seasons of the show.
32,pfmpp1_00033,Did you touch any lasers?
33,pfmpp1_00034,Matt Heath urinal cakes for prize task win!
34,pfmpp1_00035,Those art heist task attempts were both so shit it was funny.
35,pfmpp1_00036,"Just finished the episode on TVNZ. I think I laughed the hardest at Matt's charade interpretation of Jenny Shipley becoming PM and just how fast Jeremy got it lmao, something about that really got to me. Loved that live round! Curious to see how it's taken by the overseas viewers 😂"
36,pfmpp1_00037,Did anyone else also figure out the umbrella task final location before it was revealed?
37,pfmpp1_00038,"If Laura gets beat out for the win in the final episode, I’m going to be really sad."
38,pfmpp1_00039,This whole season is a fucking banger.
39,pfmpp1_00040,"As others have noted, Jeremy has made great improvements in this series. That said, I still cannot stand when he completely skips over and doesn't say a word about one of the contestants tasks (in his defense this might be an issue with the editing, but it pisses me off when he moves on without talking about one of the contestants at all)."
40,pfmpp1_00041,This episode changed my mind on who I want to win. I was rooting for Laura but Guy's first date with Paul had me mesmerised
41,pfmpp1_00042,"26 points is usually an unachievable total for a single episode, impressive!"
42,pfmpp1_00043,"I too have complained about Jeremy in the past, but I feel the series is all coming together in the moment Jeremy says, ""Finally, you have understood the task."" My only disappointment is that Urzila did not use the art heist as the opportunity for her and Paul box and/or wrestle. It was nice that she set him adrift in the sewage pond, but this still needs to happen next episode!! Are they not allowed to drink anymore? Because of the hop-scotch task? eta: If there is one task UK takes from NZ please let it be taking Alex on a date"
43,pfmpp1_00044,David really did turn that tie into a thong! Wait guy did too!
44,pfmpp1_00045,I didn’t touch any lasers. Did you?
45,pfmpp1_00046,Paul's cheeky little face after Urzila's comment in the beginning of the dating task 💚. Just steal away my heart you idiot!
46,pfmpp1_00047,A fantastic episode however Laura was massively underscored and David and guy definitely should be gotten 5 points each in the tie task
47,pfmpp1_00048,The prize task on NZ is so much better. Edible looking but bit edible! Genius!
48,pfmpp1_00049,"The innovative tie wearing task was a bit of an odd one scoring-wise. I think the tie loincloth deserved the most points for commitment to the show (with perhaps David edging it for the painted tie). Urzila's was rubbish (a tie bandana plus toilet rolls is still a tie bandana), and Matt's was shit. Laura did just cover a headband with tie material but the laces were a neat addition plus it actually looked good. I would have scored: Dave 5, Guy 4, Laura 3, Matt 2 and Urzila 1."
49,pfmpp1_00050,"Another great episode. All the tasks were good even the prize and live task which are often the weakest, Matt finally coming into his own and even drinking the petrol. This season has surpassed Season 7 UK to be the best for me now."
50,pfmpp1_00051,Matt needlessly complicating the art heist task! Hilarious!
51,pfmpp1_00052,Poor Paul being accidentally kicked.
52,pfmpp1_00053,"""Next time on Taskmaster NZ: With the series drawing to a close, Laura is still ahead, but only by three points, making it a two horse race for Jeremy's head. Can Guy close the gap & claim victory, or is victory just out of reach? Meanwhile, it's a three way race for the wooden spoon that can still go to any of the other three because, let's face it, they're out of contention unless Laura & Guy have a shocker next week. Tune in next time on Taskmaster NZ..."" (I hope someone finds this funny)"
53,pfmpp1_00054,"Honestly, that tieara did look rather cute on Paul."
54,pfmpp1_00055,Paul Williams is also a Fulham fan. Mind. Blown. 🤯
55,pfmpp1_00056,"Were there more tasks than usual this episode, or am I losing it? Art heist, umbrella task, first date, and tie task in between the prize and studio tasks. Usually there are five total, right?"
56,pfmpp1_00057,Can’t help but feel that Jeremy was favouring Matt and Urzilla to rebalance the series scores somewhat.
57,pfmpp1_00058,"Absolutely wonderful 'trick' this episode, I suspected something was up with it and I'm ecstatic one of them clocked it."
58,pfmpp1_00059,The penultimate episode. Should be great.
59,pfmpp1_00060,This entire episode was gold!
60,pfmpp1_00061,"Holy shit this episode was good. Every episode this series has been funnier than the last. Tasks are great too. Dunno why they're so good, but UK needs to take a page from their book."
61,pfmpp1_00062,That preview of the final has me very excited!!
62,pfmpp1_00063,Matt Heath umbrella genius!
63,pfmpp1_00064,"I was saddened that there were no extreme Correos losing his mind and falling off his chair with laughter (or clinging onto a tub of onions) in this episode. Good episode, but definitely the least funny / crazy in a few episodes, possibly the least funny of the season yet."
64,pfmpp1_00065,Can’t wait to watch tonight!
65,pfmpp1_00066,Is there a new link to the discord
66,pfmpp1_00067,
67,pfmpp1_00068,
0,pkdfwt_00001,Sorry I got my days mixed up due to Labour Day.
1,pkdfwt_00002,I've lost my mind at how good this series is. SO SOLID. SO WARM HEARTED. SO HILARIOUS. a PERFECT cast and the tasks were so perfectly lined up for magic.
2,pkdfwt_00003,"I'm not ready to say goodbye to this cast. Another season of them, please!"
3,pkdfwt_00004,"Thank you Taskmaster NZ for making me pay more attention to NZ comedy to keep seeing some of those familiar faces again (from nice Funny Girls, absolutely insane Jackass-y Back Of The Y or NZ attempt at The Day Today in Eating Media Lunch to things like Late Night Big Breakfast)."
4,pkdfwt_00005,I feel like there just isn't enough praise for Matt Heath nailing some tasks while initially not being fully aware of what Taskmaster is like (he said it in the Q&A).
5,pkdfwt_00006,This is top 3 seasons easily. Of any Taskmaster.
6,pkdfwt_00007,"I was surprised that, apparently, only one person discovered Angella. As soo as I saw that costume, I was convinced that would turn out to be Paul - it obviously wasn't, but how did no-one else at least try to check who was in the costume just in case. Also, the milk/microwave task was genius."
7,pkdfwt_00008,"so many gold, gold moments. i haven’t done the maths past one of the tasks but it seems to average out to 40 seconds of footage sourced from 20 minutes of task. massive shoutout to luke earl and ben winter, the editors of this stunning show! takes comedic timing, technical capability, and a whoooole lot of patience. 🥇"
8,pkdfwt_00009,"I was laughing at David's meltdown about his salad. ""I balanced them with the acid and the fats! I tossed it so well"""
9,pkdfwt_00010,David Correos reacting to Rumpelstiltskin in the middle of a breakdown over shoelaces was not something I knew I needed in my life.
10,pkdfwt_00011,"That milk/microwave task was one of the most brilliant ideas I've seen on any version of this show. Perfectly executed, not a trick, just a question of trust and patience. This show is really knocking it out of the park."
11,pkdfwt_00012,"Guy complimenting caravan Paul's looks was wonderful. I'm gonna miss seeing that sexy, psychopathic, shit-eating grin of his."
12,pkdfwt_00013,"Really enjoyed the Doppelgänger task, love these running around tasks. The best part of this episode was David realising during the milk task that his time is actually good, his change of expression - pure Gold!😂😂 The shoe lace task was pretty mean 2h untying shoe laces 😱 Congratulations to Laura, well deserved 👍🏻🎉 Great season 2!"
13,pkdfwt_00014,Angela cameo was unexpected but very welcome. Loved it when Urzila just shoved camera in her face.
14,pkdfwt_00015,David hugging Paul was so wholesome. It does seem like these comedians have actually become friends over the course of filming
15,pkdfwt_00016,"And so wraps one of the greatest seasons of Taskmaster ever. Possibly even the best, but I’ll have to let the dust settle a little more before I make that call. Taskmaster NZ’s really shaping up to be something phenomenal."
16,pkdfwt_00017,"Loved the Pauls task, one I think would be a lot of fun on the UK show especially the That is...not how I thought Rumpelstiltskin ended wtf? I'll really miss David's studio reactions. ""Huge puddle of cum"" was a heck of a TM quote but I'm not surprised it didn't make the episode title somehow..."
17,pkdfwt_00018,I need David to sell his calendar
18,pkdfwt_00019,"Much like Mike Wozniak, Guy and David may been runners up, but they are winners in my heart. What a phenomenal series. I think this is second only to UK Series 7 for the all time greatest Taskmaster series. Borderline perfection."
19,pkdfwt_00020,David is gonna go down as an all-timer on all fronts.
20,pkdfwt_00021,"That was an amazing episode, and really just an incredible season, with David as the hands down star. He had three tasks take more than an hour, and not in the way of he starts something and walks away with it still going on, but actual being present and putting effort in the whole time. Just absolutely ridiculous."
21,pkdfwt_00022,"Lol, got this from the YouTube comments on an upload, but if you go to 28:55 of the episode, someone in the audience yells, “what? That was disgusting!” after Jeremy gave the win to the three friends."
22,pkdfwt_00023,Fuck David's expression during the shoe lace task will be my all time favourites. He is the ULTIMATE chaos energy. Mf stayed shirtless for the whole time after that.
23,pkdfwt_00024,"Best season ever for me. Started strong, continued strong, finished strong."
24,pkdfwt_00025,"Right up there with Series 5, 11, and 4 as one of the best series of Taskmaster."
25,pkdfwt_00026,I think this was one of the strongest and funniest series. Sure I didn’t catch all the references and names but I was laughing so hard every episode.
26,pkdfwt_00027,"Am so sad that's it is now over! By far one of the best taskmaster series ever, it definitely holds it own against the UK version!"
27,pkdfwt_00028,Of course it was David who got the shoelace task.
28,pkdfwt_00029,"Great episode. Loved Jeremy pulled out the Mike Hosking impression been a while since he's done that. Amazing season. The live stream posted elsewhere was a good watch for some insights. Jeremy explained his scoring for this week's prize task and revealed he gets flack from collogues at another job for some of it. Sunscreen task was meant to be a tie break task until people started building stuff. Talked about 2 tasks that didn't air. ""I'm thinking of a word"" only Matt got it as 'No' but was a tiebreak task. And ""defend yourself"" which was cut for time. Did some cast suggestions for s3. Please let Jason Hoyte be on it."
29,pkdfwt_00030,Here's a link to the reaction stream: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1142458677
30,pkdfwt_00031,Love the fact who won the episode. Especially after he got that task. And congratulations to the winner.
31,pkdfwt_00032,David needs to get an honorary spot when the NZ CoC happens in 3 years.
32,pkdfwt_00033,Haven't watched the episode yet but I really hope they pull a Taskmaster Norway and bring back David for the next season. Gonna miss his outbursts in the studio
33,pkdfwt_00034,Wonderful final episode for a magnificent series.
34,pkdfwt_00035,Such a great finish to a wonderful season. I highly recommend watching the video of the Q&A as well; there’s a really joyous group energy.
35,pkdfwt_00036,"People are saying David was great which he was but I really thought Laura was just brilliant all season long. Ursula was the consistent low point though, she had some funny moments but mostly just seemed to be annoyed to be there so often."
36,pkdfwt_00037,"It was a very good time indeed, but still went by way too fast."
37,pkdfwt_00038,"Oof... that string task was the first one I just found cruel. All the other solo tasks I got a good laugh at, but this one... I think it was just too much. Over 2 hours of untying string? It felt mean spirited, even if it obviously wasn't intended to be."
38,pkdfwt_00039,JUST WOW!!
39,pkdfwt_00040,Was David this episode the most points awarded in an episode between both versions?
40,pkdfwt_00041,
41,pkdfwt_00042,Soon...
42,pkdfwt_00043,
0,pu2qnr_00001,So much more swearing this season. It’s great.
1,pu2qnr_00002,EXTREMELY UNDERWHELMED by everyone’s attempts at cool jam spreading. EXTREMELY OVERWHELMED by my love for the riddle task & the plethora of quotes it birthed.
2,pu2qnr_00003,"is it possible to get subtitles for this show somewhere? especially the new episodes? i love the british shows, im coming over from 8oo10c and 8oo10cdc, and there i could find episodes with subs, which greatly helped me with some of the thicc accent guests also the youtube generated subs are not great"
3,pu2qnr_00004,Great ep! I already like the cast and cant wait for more.
4,pu2qnr_00005,Great episode. Noticed that live task was very similar to TMNZ s1 live task
5,pu2qnr_00006,
6,pu2qnr_00007,"At first I thought VCM would bend Greg eventually with her logic but she is almost broken by the end of Episode 1! I seriously wanted to give her a hug, poor Victoria."
7,pu2qnr_00008,"Anyway, I'm amazed that nobody thought of covering the camera lens"
8,pu2qnr_00009,How is it 2021 and doesn't get added to nz streaming sites same day. Most other shows do. Ep 1 on 28th
9,pu2qnr_00010,Alan has completely screwed himself in the studio task and I love it.
10,pu2qnr_00011,
11,pu2qnr_00012,Can't believe Greg got table tennis but not surfgami
12,pu2qnr_00013,"This task would have been ideal for Hugh Dennis. ""Scissors please""."
13,pu2qnr_00014,"Desiree's attempt at the balloon task had old school frantic taskmaster energy, like Tim Key with the bathtub or Romesh with the watermelon."
14,pu2qnr_00015,Desiree: “The most comfortable thing on Earth are boobs.” Morgana: Excited gasp. Same.
15,pu2qnr_00016,"Morgana out-filthing Sally Philips by a significant margin within the first 7 minutes of episode one, well done, lass."
16,pu2qnr_00017,"""If I can't see you, it's hiding"". Can't argue with that logic."
17,pu2qnr_00018,"Ominous signs that VCM has Baddiel'd it. The classic ""Incredibly intelligent = bad at the tasks"" chestnut"
18,pu2qnr_00019,The painting tasks are always good and this was one of the better ones Congrats to Victoria for the worst attempt at a portrait task so far
19,pu2qnr_00020,Victoria's right. I love the split second where the water is still in the balloon shape before it drops.
20,pu2qnr_00021,Alan Davies taken the Jo brand route of urgency
21,pu2qnr_00022,"""Do Not Try This At Home"" Yeah cheers Channel 4, was just rushing to chuck my cutlery draw at a balloon."
22,pu2qnr_00023,Guessing they've pushed the wrong version since everything seems bleeped out.
23,pu2qnr_00024,"I just about died when the portcullis fell late. And I'm glad I didn't have to do the live task, because there was no way Greg was going to guess ""observing asteroid occultations""."
24,pu2qnr_00025,God Morgana’s studio outfit is incredible.
25,pu2qnr_00026,“You can’t sit on Father Christmas’s face!” “Oh yes you can 😉” Morgana coming in as a fast favourite.
26,pu2qnr_00027,"I can just imagine Greg saying to somebody at Channel 4 who aired the wrong version: ""You fucked it"""
27,pu2qnr_00028,Buying items with time is such a fun concept.
28,pu2qnr_00029,"right, I've fallen in love with Morgana after episode 1 and there's no changing it"
29,pu2qnr_00030,"This is easily the most comfortable group so far. The chemistry between all 5 of them, and with Greg and Alex, is really easy and really happy right off the bat."
30,pu2qnr_00031,"Absolutely in love with Morgana! But honestly, the whole cast just feels great. It usually takes me a few episodes to get a feel for the contestants, but here everything just clicked immediately. I feel like this will be a very fun series."
31,pu2qnr_00032,Imagine if BUBBLY FUCK was censored. It'd have been horrible
32,pu2qnr_00033,
33,pu2qnr_00034,"I think Morgana just had the best ""Fuck around with the prizes"" that's ever happened."
0,pyr13b_00001,The company who broadcast Channel 4 and C5 had a fire at their main building last week - all those channels are still experiencing major sound/visual problems and have no subtitle options.
1,pyr13b_00002,
2,pyr13b_00003,"Absolutely love Guz. He's got this chaotic energy but seems like such a genuinely nice guy who is always having a good time. That task with the hopper was absolutely fantastic. He reminds me of a more jovial Jamali, who I also loved. Not familiar of any of his work before this but really enjoy him through two episodes."
3,pyr13b_00004,Are there no outtakes this series?
4,pyr13b_00005,"another great ep. guz is probably edging out as my favorite, but all other 4 are a close second."
5,pyr13b_00006,
6,pyr13b_00007,"I love everyone, but weirdly Alan pulled ahead in this episode for me. His goofy positivity is so much fun to watch."
7,pyr13b_00008,I’m sat here crying laughing at “spit on your hand and slap it” lmfao
8,pyr13b_00009,Victoria is even handling the scoring now. What a woman.
9,pyr13b_00010,Greg saying he will get a couple of space hoppers and go through Hyde Park with Morgana sounded so genuinly like a date idea.
10,pyr13b_00011,Oh Victoria I love you doing the scoring before they worked it out
11,pyr13b_00012,Should Victoria not get 9 for the triple points square?
12,pyr13b_00013,Mt Kasarest is anagram of Taskmaster! Another addition to Mask Taster
13,pyr13b_00014,"""This is more of your very, very, eloquent bullshit."""
14,pyr13b_00015,Morgana’s feral glee at watching Alex eat that disgusting mess are why I think I’m falling in love with her.
15,pyr13b_00016,"I think Morgana truly encapsulates the spirit of Taskmaster: she wriggles around the edge of the rules, she is very funny, and she is MERCILESS towards Alex."
16,pyr13b_00017,Thinking about Victoria’s terrible menu on off menu pod
17,pyr13b_00018,Victoria coming out with some terrifying murderer facts while painting a space hopper. God. She’s my dream woman.
18,pyr13b_00019,"Love how supportive this cast is of each other. Everyone praising Guz for slapping the space hopper, and Guz shouting 'yes Dee' across the stage during the live task, and that was just the last 15 mins of this ep."
19,pyr13b_00020,"""I don't have to eat it in one bite. [...] [...] ""OH I SHOULD HAVE DONE THOUGH!"""
20,pyr13b_00021,Morgana's scream of delight when Alex put that spoon in his mouth is already a series highlight for me.
21,pyr13b_00022,This is the most VCM prize task & explanation possible
22,pyr13b_00023,I'm a huge fan of Desiree screaming in betrayal after every spoonful like she keeps expecting it to be good
23,pyr13b_00024,Victoria has the strongest Hermione energy I've seen in scoring that task before Alex or Greg could lmao
24,pyr13b_00025,"""Very very eloquent bullshit"" I love Greg and how words flow out of his mouth. (another example: ""And then he just stood there pissing water into a bath while Rome burned.""-makes me laugh EVERY single time) Also a superficial note: VCM has very very pretty eyes."
25,pyr13b_00026,Morgana and Victoria like two drunk girls after a night out looking for their keys....
26,pyr13b_00027,"Without question one of the funniest group meetings I've ever seen. Guz shouting 'Oh shit, I got a friend' and Morgana jumping in shock and delight when she saw Desiree. Just brilliant"
27,pyr13b_00028,I seriously do not understand Alex’s willingness to put literally anything in his mouth on this show. Fair fucking play.
28,pyr13b_00029,"just realised mt kasarest is an anagram for ""taskmaster"""
29,pyr13b_00030,"I'm hoping Guz Khans' panicked stare grows more intense with every passing episode, that Morgana gets to swear as intensely as she wants, free of any censorship, and that Victoria C-M continues to stride about the Taskmaster house like an increasingly baffled History teacher who has mysteriously lost the whole of Class 3B whilst on a field trip"
30,pyr13b_00031,VICTORIA AND ALAN ARE GOING TO BE SO FUNNY. CAN’T WAIT FOR THIS TEAM DYNAMIC.
31,pyr13b_00032,I don't think I've ever been so turned on by mental maths before.
32,pyr13b_00033,Watching Alex reluctantly eat the spoonful of glop was the hardest I’ve laughed since he sat on that cake.
33,pyr13b_00034,Anyone else find it funny how the last task specifically says you cannot break the box? Jamali must've helped them work out a few bugs
34,pyr13b_00035,Morgana’s energy is exactly what I’d do on the show. Skirt the rules. Befriend my fellow contestants. Torture Alex. Flirt with Greg. Bosh.
35,pyr13b_00036,Victoria stopping in the middle of a task to eat a satsuma would be me as a contestant.
36,pyr13b_00037,"Well she may not really rock the tasks, but my god Victoria's brain is still on another level."
37,pyr13b_00038,Who was it who added “she is allergic to grapefruit” on VCM’s Wikipedia page?
38,pyr13b_00039,Morgana has such big femdom energy
39,pyr13b_00040,"At least they have learned their lesson about food from the Lee Mack ""egg and a leather wallet"" debacle from last series. MAKE IT VEGETARIAN."
40,pyr13b_00041,Morgana choosing option B then tasting each bag individually was so great.
41,pyr13b_00042,I didn't think I could love Victoria any more and then she describes Mr.Messy as sexy.
42,pyr13b_00043,This is turning out to be an all timer of a series. Right after NZ series 2 was. S11 was no slouch either. What a great year for the format.
43,pyr13b_00044,"Considering Alex has eaten dog food ravioli, toothpaste pie, and burnt porn, I can't imagine how bad that blended up monstrosity tasted."
44,pyr13b_00045,"Morganas laugh as she made Alex eat it, that’s bound to be a few points"
45,pyr13b_00046,"“We could have won this task” Who we, Guz Khan’t?"
46,pyr13b_00047,Great episode! Really loving Victoria and Guz. Guz's childlike enthusiasm and delight is just a joy to watch. The only dud task in my opinion was the mountaineering task...don't know if maybe something was lost in the edit. I would have liked to have seen the films in full from above.
47,pyr13b_00048,"Channel 4, please film Greg and Morgana's Space Hopper Adventure"
48,pyr13b_00049,I have underestimated Alan Davies.
49,pyr13b_00050,I liked when he slapped the ball.
50,pyr13b_00051,The lab has really seen some shit over the years hasn't it
51,pyr13b_00052,VCM mental math!! Wowza again?
52,pyr13b_00053,"Really annoyed at whoever was directing for the live studio task this week, we didn't see how ANYONE got inside the red box."
53,pyr13b_00054,Victoria looks smug but embarrassed about that smugness everytime she does well. It's adorable
54,pyr13b_00055,I bet Morgana is going to pop the hopper. Edit: ahahaha!! Close enough!
55,pyr13b_00056,Best team reaction since Rose Matafeo's excited little jump in s9. That's exactly how I wanted the teams to be split up.
56,pyr13b_00057,"I'm with Morgana - the idea of having to eat a spoonful of ""unidentified object"" causes me an indescribable amount of stress, I felt myself gagging just watching that"
57,pyr13b_00058,Absolute Gus Khan-age.
58,pyr13b_00059,Who is a faster calculator? Joe Thomas or Victoria?
59,pyr13b_00060,"I thought Victoria should’ve gotten the 5 points for the prize task, the scrabble square and the way she presented it sounded like a winner. Alex eating the blended food has to be the most disgusting thing he’s tasted in the history of the show. Absolutely loved Victoria doing the math for the painting the ball challenge correctly all in her head."
60,pyr13b_00061,
61,pyr13b_00062,
62,pyr13b_00063,I really hope Victoria does well next week I don’t want her to be last again
63,pyr13b_00064,"Morgana was a firm favourite before this season even began (I developed a huge crush on her after I saw her being utterly charming in Richard Ayoade's Travel Man series), but I must saythat Guz is absolutely spectacular. The green ball task really cracked me up. Love the series so far, and the dynamic and comraderie between the contestants seems really upbeat and supportive."
64,pyr13b_00065,I think Morgana is going to win this series. I think I'm falling in love with Desiree. And I think the cast for this series is the best since series 5.
65,pyr13b_00066,"If the glove fits, you must acquit. But also: if there’s a drop of green, you’re off the scene."
66,pyr13b_00067,"""We all liked it when you slapped it"" yep definitely a niche fetish...."
67,pyr13b_00068,"Listened to the podcast and felt so validated when Paul Williams said1 that Gus getting 4 points and Victoria getting 1 was a travesty. 1: that is, would have said, if he wasn't a Taskmaster assistant, so he would never say that."
68,pyr13b_00069,I bloody love Guz
69,pyr13b_00070,I like that Guz take was filmed at night. Looks very cool.
70,pyr13b_00071,"You have to hand it to Guz, when he fucks something up he really fucks it up."
71,pyr13b_00072,He's 6 years older apparently... 55 vs 49
72,pyr13b_00073,I've never been so physically turned off at a task as I was with the baggie task.
73,pyr13b_00074,"Yessss Morgana, deflate it; she’s so good at following the rules while going around the edge of what’s allowed"
74,pyr13b_00075,"Victoria coming in clutch with quick maths. My god, woman. Good thing David Mitchell knows how lucky he is to have her."
75,pyr13b_00076,"Another great episode, but I don't think I'll be able to handle another episode of Victoria being last"
76,pyr13b_00077,You can tell there's actual thought that has gone into Victoria's passion for a post blow dry Mr Messy!
77,pyr13b_00078,"Loved this episode, but hated the food task. I don't like any of the gross-out stuff. I'm so excited that Desiree, Guz, and Morgana are on the same team. Those 3 are my faves, and you can tell they're gonna be loads of fun. I liked the way the spacehopper task was judged. People complain a lot about Taskmaster docking people for creativity, so I'm glad Guz was rewarded for taking a risk. His excitement throughout the episode was adorable. If either Morgana or Guz win it's gonna be somewhat gutting to know they could've been on a series with Wozniak. Especially Morgana since she's close friends with him and they're both total weirdos."
78,pyr13b_00079,Morgana shouldve just put it in a garbage bag with the paint. Hopper Shake N Bake.
79,pyr13b_00080,"I’m generally pretty easy to please when it comes to casts, but I honestly couldn’t care less who wins this series. And I mean that in the best possible way."
80,pyr13b_00081,Morgana is on fire for being a genius this episode.
81,pyr13b_00082,Victoria....yeah she is on the wrong show...but I love it
82,pyr13b_00083,Guz looks so pleased with himself. I’m happy for him.
83,pyr13b_00084,"Here are my random thoughts - I really like Victoria in the studio. The maths thing was funny as well as explaining why she didn't pic the 8th square on a chess board. I hope she improves in the actual tasks. - The foood task was nice, but I did not enjoy the closeups. Also I'm happy that it was actual food that you can guess. I really enjoyed the contrast between VCM and Desiree - I'm not sure how I feel about Morgana and Greg flirting. I think it's funny but it does make me wonder...hmmm - I'm glad they didn't give extra points for being mean to Alex in this episode. While I enjoy their banter and I don't care about points. I don't want the show to be just about Alex being kicked down - Desiree is growing on me. She really goes all out for the tasks!"
84,pyr13b_00085,The moment Morgana realises Alex will eat anything for the show
85,pyr13b_00086,Morgana channeling Rhod with that food task. Punishing Alex
86,pyr13b_00087,"Those shots of Morgana and Desiree that we got while the Taskmaster was singing his song is what I miss during the location tasks. I can't imagine there wasn't reaction to Gus' ball falling and rolling around or Morgana making Alex taste his puree. These last two prize tasks were great, and I feel like the banter in the studio is elevated with both Victoria and Desiree in the studio. Victoria's prizes in general feel like they'd be one pointers, but to talk her way to even three points seems like a big deal. Desiree needs to get a shout too cause she BSed her Myth of Narcissus last episode and most likely BSed her backstory for the team task, haha. You can feel the tide changing with Gus saying they shouldn't clap Greg's joke about Alex, then subsequently trying to throw Alex under the bus with hand spitting and such. So based on his interview about the series I can see how the five of them gang up on the two hosts. Haha. I know some people are concerned about the chemistry between Greg and Morgana, but based on Morgana drawing him playing football last week, it's safe to say she didn't do her research. Can't blame him though: I was in the same boat as Ed last week and only watched snippets of her time on Travel Man, so I didn't know what she was like outside of her character work. I was already taken when she said we can sit on Father Christmas' face last week. Just as I thought NZ S2 was going to be one of the best casts overall, this series is already in the running to overtake them."
87,pyr13b_00088,"I love how well Victoria is selling her square, she gets the game 100%"
88,pyr13b_00089,Apparently Victoria and Alan’s plan is not to win but just have a great time and getting smashed. That’s my kind of team.
89,pyr13b_00090,Victoria has a seriously good pallet!
90,pyr13b_00091,Alex's side-glances are the best
91,pyr13b_00092,The fall of guz space hopper was inevitable and hilarious
92,pyr13b_00093,"""Alex ate a bunch of food he blended together for me. Funniest shit I've ever seen."" - Morgana, based on her hysterical laugh"
93,pyr13b_00094,Guz is at night because they had to go and buy another hopper after Morgana had her go.
94,pyr13b_00095,I am 99.95% sure the edit cut around at least one hug when the teams met each other for the first time.
95,pyr13b_00096,"All right, time to fess up: who else googled ""mr messy blow dryed""? ... Anyone? It can't just be me, surely."
96,pyr13b_00097,"Morgana going through the bins, you genius"
97,pyr13b_00098,I think I love Morgana
98,pyr13b_00099,The food tasks never disappoint and this one was particularly good.
99,pyr13b_00100,"Alex not doing anything about the falling spacehopper was very reminiscent of Paul Williams in NZ Series 2 watching Matt Heath's ""wing"" rolling into the water. Same guilty energy."
100,pyr13b_00101,Just me or does it look a bit washed out?
101,pyr13b_00102,I'm just waiting for Greg's Chris Eubanks impression at some point
102,pyr13b_00103,"Everyone had their moment on this episode. Morgana pretending to piss paint and the way she said ""no"" when Alex mentioned that she hadn't eaten any of the blended ingredients killed me. So far, this season is among my favorites."
103,pyr13b_00104,This is the most bonkers cast since S7. Very promising.
104,pyr13b_00105,I love Victoria but seems to be struggling a little in first 2 eps. Hope she can find her feet
105,pyr13b_00106,Morgana’s solutions are from another world!
106,pyr13b_00107,"Good God, is Victoria's GoPro close-up incredibly beautiful."
107,pyr13b_00108,"Victoria really isn't doing too badly. She's completely bombed a few tasks but done OK in others; She's placed 1st and 2nd and had a couple of 3rds (One 5-pointer, one 4-pointer, four 3's, four 1's) Yet, if this trend from the first two episodes continues, she'll be last, 45 points behind the eventual winner, and with the distance between 4th and 5th double the distance between 1st and 4th. Something is not right :("
108,pyr13b_00109,I need to stop eating while I watch Taskmaster.
109,pyr13b_00110,"Might as well get messy, enjoy ourselves and shit"
110,pyr13b_00111,Taaaaskmaster's oooooon. Iiiiiit is on nooooooow.
111,pyr13b_00112,That's what the fuck that is 😂😂😂😂
112,pyr13b_00113,Victoria looks so flustered when she can't do a task and it's cute
113,pyr13b_00114,Alan and Victoria are teaming up? This ought to be fun!
114,pyr13b_00115,Good episode but don't agree with the scoring of the green space hopper. Rules specifically say to do it without making a mess yet Guz was by far the messiest and got 4 points... :(
115,pyr13b_00116,Morgana's slicing and then painting of the hopper was somehow very soothing and satisfying.
116,pyr13b_00117,VCM eating things. Might as well be Nigella.
117,pyr13b_00118,Honestly Alex’s fetish for eating weird things is getting out of hand!
118,pyr13b_00119,Did anyone think the mountaineering task was similar to the Monty Python sketch where they were climbing Uxbridge Road?!
119,pyr13b_00120,TIL Death tastes like gravy
120,pyr13b_00121,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but has any other prize task been awarded points in the same order as the prizes were presented? They were shown in order: Desiree Morgana Victoria Alan Guz And the points were: Desiree - 1 Morgana - 2 Victoria - 3 Alan - 4 Guz - 5 Just something I thought was interesting"
121,pyr13b_00122,"I don’t think anything really fazes Alan. He’s just like, yeah, this is happening, might as well get on with it."
122,pyr13b_00123,Guz 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
123,pyr13b_00124,I was just watching Squid Game just before this and my brain must've gotten confused because I was so anxious for the players haha
124,pyr13b_00125,Holy shit Victoria smashed that.
125,pyr13b_00126,Morgana going through bin stuff is on another level! I didn’t think of that! Proud of Alex eating everything he was asked to!!
126,pyr13b_00127,I would 1000% watch a show with guz and Morgana. Incredible energies and chemistry so far!
127,pyr13b_00128,VCM stars in Keeping It Light...
128,pyr13b_00129,Oh going through the bags is so smart!!! Morgan’s my favourite I think. Also thank you to whoever recommended Desiree’s episode of Edventuring because it made me a fan of her before this series and I’m really enjoying her outbursts. ‘Oatmeal and Death’ makes a great episode title
129,pyr13b_00130,Should be a bonus point for the slap
130,pyr13b_00131,What's the deal with the face-cams? Are they reducing crew or something.. they aren't very flattering 😂
131,pyr13b_00132,"""WHY IS THAT LIKE THAT!?!"""
132,pyr13b_00133,"Not to be pedantic, but in the team task the objective was to plant the flag. Team of 3 didn’t actually do that. They were still super entertaining though and definitely deserved the 5 points but they didn’t actually complete the task"
133,pyr13b_00134,"Guz's painting attempt was pretty funny but no way did he deserve 4 points. But I still assert the cast feels fairly even regarding effort/skill and so I am not at all mad he won the episode. I'm still not on board with the live final tasks but maybe E3 will have something a bit more interesting to watch. All in all, still liking the season thus far and really liking the ladies more than I thought I would."
134,pyr13b_00135,ALAN AND VICTORIA! YESS
135,pyr13b_00136,Someone needs to start a series pun counter for Victoria. The woman has skillz.
136,pyr13b_00137,Victoria should be a professional food guesser.
137,pyr13b_00138,"Alex wasn’t the only one who almost threw up, so funny but so disgusting to watch, was torn between watching and looking away 🤢"
138,pyr13b_00139,So much pedantry in the prize round.
139,pyr13b_00140,8/10 for Victoria wowsers!
140,pyr13b_00141,Morgana you clever bitch
141,pyr13b_00142,I love this series and I love this cast
142,pyr13b_00143,"""Drips innit"""
143,pyr13b_00144,"Not a fan of ""eat something disgusting"" tasks. Leave that to tacky ITV shows."
0,q3fwx5_00001,"Alan and Victoria seem complete opposites lol. Sometimes it seems to Victoria's annoyance, but maybe I'm just misreading everything."
1,q3fwx5_00002,"What is the song playing for Copy Alex, and how is it not all over TikTok right now?"
2,q3fwx5_00003,I'm really looking forward to getting a live audience back in. It's just weaker without it
3,q3fwx5_00004,VCM bringing tippex is doubly bad when you realise she mentioned typing (didn’t she?) and so presumably owns a typewriter. I think it could well have bagged her 3/4/5 points depending on how cool it looked.
4,q3fwx5_00005,"""Is that a crow?"" ""No it's a raven. See, here's the thing..."""
5,q3fwx5_00006,"As someone who falls in the younger age range, Guz's prize would have been more believable if it were a Razr or something. Haha. I was recently struggling to find a VHS player for finding out what we had at work in a decades-old office, I don't like using Tipp-ex (but know of people who use it), and old appliances always seem to be built much better. A difficult round, but I actually would have increased VCM and Morgana's points and knocked down Guz's. The backing track to Copy Alex was a banger, but I'm pretty sure it would have taken me three tries to nail: once to watch, once to take notes, then one more time to get the timing down. Haha. I know there was concern about Morgana getting what seemed like a lot of help from Alex in the Sand Bridge task, but unless they edited everyone else's footage down drastically, she was the only one actively looking for the trick. Under that time pressure, I don't think anyone would have connected the dots from the raven called Troy to the table being the Table Horse. I wonder what Tim Key and company thought the wellies task would come out like, unless they originally had regular low-cut shoes then realized the motion when walking was too much. The ""peg leg motion"" (as Desiree put it in the podcast) should have actually given Guz, Alan, and Victoria a bit of a boost since theirs were less disorienting. Others have also pointed out how much more difficult Alan/Victoria's items were in the live task: while dragon was relatively OK, blanket and microscope seemed much more conceptual than the younger team's tank, worm, and wrecking ball. Overall a strong episode, but I would have loved to see the panel initially laugh at Desiree eating sand and Alan doing his wellies task."
6,q3fwx5_00007,The wide shot had nothing to do with the task. Poor Alan :(
7,q3fwx5_00008,"I strongly suspected Morgana had studied Taskmaster before, and her inspecting the whole area beforehand confirms it. Whatta woman."
8,q3fwx5_00009,"I never would have realised how much a camera on the foot makes it look like someone has a weird jerky limp, I expected a certain rhythm to a stride that simply doesn't exist."
9,q3fwx5_00010,"""I did not airshag the church."" - Alex Horne, 2021"
10,q3fwx5_00011,STRENGTH IN ARCHES
11,q3fwx5_00012,"""Not in a racist way, just in a murderous way."" I love Desiree"
12,q3fwx5_00013,I love Alan’s approach to everything. Just no sense of urgency or competition. He’s just happy to be out of the house and having fun.
13,q3fwx5_00014,"Also, shoutout to Desiree's ""NOT IN A RACIST WAS, JUST A MURDEROUS WAY."" We stan an equal-opportunity murderer."
14,q3fwx5_00015,ONLY TWO POINTS FOR ALAN?! HIS WAS THE MOST TOUCHING AND MEMORABLE.
15,q3fwx5_00016,Snake 2...this times it's personal!
16,q3fwx5_00017,Tonsillectomy and dragon as consecutive guesses. I fucking love Victoria.
17,q3fwx5_00018,"Great episode, I am only sad that we did not see that Magnificent Beast Greg Davies drape himself across that purple chaise longue in a seductive fashion. Missed opportunity right there."
18,q3fwx5_00019,I think Alan's was still more legitimately a sand bridge.
19,q3fwx5_00020,"> Sees table > Immediately thinks back to ""Debajo de la Mesa"""
20,q3fwx5_00021,Victoria C-M muttering darkly about Brunel within 20 seconds is exactly what I predicted she would do. God love her.
21,q3fwx5_00022,"I am so happy the prize tasks have taken a step up this season. They've been very much lacking recently, and this is a return to form."
22,q3fwx5_00023,I can’t believe Alan killed off Victoria Coren Mitchell!
23,q3fwx5_00024,I’ll say this for Victoria: what she has in memorising dance moves she absolutely does not have in building sand bridges.
24,q3fwx5_00025,"I loved the return of the river it also showed none of the contestants (exept maybe Morgana ) watched the rest of the show and I would have been dissapointed if there hadn't been a ""trick"" on that task"
25,q3fwx5_00026,"Everything about Alan's film was absolutely delightful. Him cheerfully narrating their knitted selves being in mortal danger, the giant homicidal ducks and the friendly octopus, Victoria accidentally drowning (""Yeah, that was you, yeah."" [shocked Victoria face] ""You weren't meant to drown but you came off the stick."") and just everything about his demeanour. I was just so charmed by the whole thing. Desiree is right, he comes across as such a great cuddly dad. (Not just in this task, but especially prominent here.)"
26,q3fwx5_00027,I feel like I don’t even need to see No Time To Die now. What could possibly top Victoria’s film?
27,q3fwx5_00028,"Fun fact: this episode marks the first major character death in the shows history, having killed off Victoria-Coren-Mitchell at the hands of Alan Davies"
28,q3fwx5_00029,"Anyone else think ""there's strength in arches"" when they saw the very same table and similar task. I would have done what Morgana did and look around/under the table. Not our first rodeo Mr Horne."
29,q3fwx5_00030,Alan was robbed in the film task. His was so fun and so Alan - just a grown man playing with toys on TV. Reminds of when he gets props on QI and he gets so silly.
30,q3fwx5_00031,"""I always said Pussy was dangerous"" is the best line ever in a bond film."
31,q3fwx5_00032,"""Victoria, can you speak?"" ""No, I'm underwater."""
32,q3fwx5_00033,"Guz's film had big ""Bob Mortimer with a Go-Pro"" energy"
33,q3fwx5_00034,"Desiree's film is such a treat for a TM fan, there are ducks, Linda, notes in TM font, tied up Alex, what more could you want"
34,q3fwx5_00035,I don't think I've ever been as happy to see someone absolutely nail a task like Alan with the sand bridge. Victoria's dance comes close too.
35,q3fwx5_00036,Morgana is so supportive of all her fellow competitors!
36,q3fwx5_00037,"Of all the things I expected Guz to say ""I saw this shit on Countryfile"" was not one of them."
37,q3fwx5_00038,"Alan got completely screwed in the film task, I guess everyone looked shit whilst filming"
38,q3fwx5_00039,"""The dove of peace vomits forth a message"" should definitely be included in the taskmaster book of quotes"
39,q3fwx5_00040,"YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS TO LIVE GET OUT (NOT IN A RACIST WAY, JUST IN AN EVIL MURDEROUS WAY)"
40,q3fwx5_00041,"Jack and Rose WHERE! It’s all Alan and Victoria now, babay."
41,q3fwx5_00042,This task is making me like Alan quite a lot.
42,q3fwx5_00043,VCM didn't really make any use of the fact the camera is on the wellies...
43,q3fwx5_00044,How is the episode not called Air Shagging the Church?
44,q3fwx5_00045,Alan was the only one to use the wellies for their designed purpose of being waterproof
45,q3fwx5_00046,lol morgana knows to look around
46,q3fwx5_00047,"I had a feeling Desiree was going to nail the short film task, and she absolutely delivered. She is America’s apology for our version of the show sucking so hard"
47,q3fwx5_00048,The company who broadcast Channel 4 and C5 had a fire at their main building recently; all those channels are still experiencing major sound/visual problems and have no subtitle options.
48,q3fwx5_00049,Am I the only one who thinks Desiree would be a great radio host? Her voice is subtly low but also smooth in a way that many radio hosts have.
49,q3fwx5_00050,Alan is just that kid from Outnumbered all grown up right?
50,q3fwx5_00051,Desiree testing an unidentified substance by eating some is just fantastic. I'm really starting to love her.
51,q3fwx5_00052,Alan's film was 10/10 I cri
52,q3fwx5_00053,I thought the dragon was a Xenomorph.
53,q3fwx5_00054,"Oh, the lovely model house and river, how we have missed you! (Probably Jon Richardson just had inexplicable flashbacks to the Good Ship Debajo de la Mesa and does not know why.)"
54,q3fwx5_00055,Why has Alan drowned knitted Victoria?
55,q3fwx5_00056,"Desiree and Morgana: thrilling adventures, solid narrative, great acting. Alan, VCM, Guz: lost their fucking minds."
56,q3fwx5_00057,"""I will reinforce it with rainbows"" was my favourite line of the episode"
57,q3fwx5_00058,Pro tip if you're going to watch the episode later for reasons and post a thread where people are going to be describing the episode turn off inbox replies.
58,q3fwx5_00059,"Does the crow/raven say ""Troy"" on it's feet?"
59,q3fwx5_00060,Morgana has a future as a horror scream queen..yikes..some set of pipes!
60,q3fwx5_00061,There's strength in arches
61,q3fwx5_00062,"I'm rather confused with the welly camera task, some of how they played out and how it was judged. The task was to shoot the most thrilling 30 second sequence wearing the welly camera. Every single one of the films was longer than 30 seconds (in some case WAY more). Plus, Guz's entry was filmed partially with a completely different camera, which means he should be DQ'd. I don't know why they included the shots of Alan taken by a normal crew member, those obviously weren't meant to be a part of his actual finished film. If you as the show want to include that sort of ""behind the camera"" footage, it should've been shown separate from the screening of his entry."
62,q3fwx5_00063,"The team of 2 got completely screwed over on that last task. Tank vs Dragon, Worm vs Blanket, Wrecking ball vs Microscope? cmon..."
63,q3fwx5_00064,"I thought Alan's was the BEST film—made best use of the wellies, wonderful cinematography, really charming—but Desiree's was definitely the most thrilling (that duck attack at the end!!) All the films where people were walking with the wellies on gave me motion sickness though >.<"
64,q3fwx5_00065,"Morgana was this close to saying ""strength in arches"" Loved Desiree's film; it was chilling! A well-deserved 5 points! I don't think anyone has ever come in last 3 episodes in a row, let alone the first 3 episodes in a series, and I never imagined it would be Victoria, but I'm still loving her and her task attempts anyway! (And it's also not as if she's that bad)"
65,q3fwx5_00066,UNDER THE TABLE
66,q3fwx5_00067,I loved Alan before the show and I don't know why but him shaking that lil piece of confetti out of his hair just made me love him even more.
67,q3fwx5_00068,Genuinely enjoyed Alan's interpretation! RIP Victoria.
68,q3fwx5_00069,I want that fainting couch SO BAD. It is gorgeous.
69,q3fwx5_00070,"The Church of Taskmaster. Finally, I have a religion."
70,q3fwx5_00071,I love Desiree and Victoria smashing the shit out of this.
71,q3fwx5_00072,"I love the occasional Urdu from Guz Khan. ""Shit ho gaya"" in the first episode and ""finish, khatam"" in this one 🤣🤣"
72,q3fwx5_00073,Still absolutely enthralled by morgana - she is a magnificent performer
73,q3fwx5_00074,Contains 'spooky scenes' apparently.
74,q3fwx5_00075,"""Me Nana's whizzer"" God I love Morgana"
75,q3fwx5_00076,Guz has some good shithousery in him
76,q3fwx5_00077,Alan 2 points?!? Nonsense!
77,q3fwx5_00078,I adore Gregs' genuine exasperation and irritation with Alex whenever he gets too pleased with himself over a task.
78,q3fwx5_00079,SOMEONE LOOKED UNDER THE TABLE.
79,q3fwx5_00080,"Also, Morgana is absolutely right about egg beaters. We had my parents' one they got from their wedding registry back in the 80s for AGES and I think my grandmother still has hers from like the 70s, both are way better than any of the newer ones I've tried"
80,q3fwx5_00081,Copying someone? Shame no one does impressions
81,q3fwx5_00082,Man Getting Hit By Welly
82,q3fwx5_00083,So even if they had those materials for the bridge task it might have been disqualified for not being a sand bridge
83,q3fwx5_00084,"Alan properly Baddiel-ing that task there, god bless him."
84,q3fwx5_00085,How is the first thing Desiree decides to do is eating the sand??
85,q3fwx5_00086,VCM what the fuck was that :')
86,q3fwx5_00087,Alan's effort was brilliant. Definitely deserves the 5! Edit: That scoring was absolutely mental from Greg
87,q3fwx5_00088,So do we reckon Victoria & Desiree have absolutely nailed it or bollocksed it up catastrophically?
88,q3fwx5_00089,"I don't know why the line which made me laugh the most is not even funny. ""Are you wearing your earpiece, Morgana?"""
89,q3fwx5_00090,"This lineup reminds me of S7, with plenty of banter and discussion in studio, and I love it"
90,q3fwx5_00091,"Simply a boss of an episode. Each character coming into their own. Morgana is cursing out alex much less frequently. Guz glows glowers and chuckles like a new born god. Alan Davies is growing on every person on the planet. Desiree is straight winnnnnnning. And of course Victoria Coren Mitchell, lilterally the smartest person in any room continues to act the fool and seem all the more cool for it. This is the taskmaster I've always wanted and didn't know I needed."
91,q3fwx5_00092,"It was nailed on when Greg started a sentence about the phone with ""that is..."" that the rest of the sentence would be ""...a lovely bit of kit"""
92,q3fwx5_00093,SPOILERS for No Time To Die in this episode
93,q3fwx5_00094,I like that Horne has a different pocket square for each. I wonder if that's something...
94,q3fwx5_00095,Horrible plastic slip-ons!
95,q3fwx5_00096,You can tell Victoria is such a smart lady <3
96,q3fwx5_00097,Only 2 for Alan? Bullshit.
97,q3fwx5_00098,When I think extravagant I think cow.
98,q3fwx5_00099,this series makes me kind disslike the scoring of Greg and (idk if it's just more extreme this series[and not only in hindsight]) how he's picking favourites (Desiree&Morgana) and victims (Alan&Victoria) edit speling of Desiree
99,q3fwx5_00100,Taaaaskmaster's oooooon. Iiiiiit is on nooooooow.
100,q3fwx5_00101,I actually quite liked all these prizes!
101,q3fwx5_00102,Anyone else think Alex helped a little too much there?
102,q3fwx5_00103,I don’t think enough people are discussing Alex’s mad TASKMASTER acronym - absolutely loved it (and Greg’s disdainful reaction!)
103,q3fwx5_00104,"Controversial perhaps, but low effort drawing Bond was far better than whatever the fuck that was Guz filmed."
104,q3fwx5_00105,Victoria 😭
105,q3fwx5_00106,Alan n VCM getting shafted with what they have to represent
106,q3fwx5_00107,Knew the moves would spell out taskmaster but also that it wouldn't really be helpful.
107,q3fwx5_00108,i don't like sand it's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere
108,q3fwx5_00109,"Does the fact that under the crow the word TROY is seen mean that, there's something in the egg or the sand bucket?"
109,q3fwx5_00110,"""dentro de la mesa"" it is..."
110,q3fwx5_00111,If that isn't the follow up to No Time To Die then I give up
111,q3fwx5_00112,Shoutout to all those Beverly Hills cops eating sand
112,q3fwx5_00113,INSIDE THE TABLE!
113,q3fwx5_00114,"Good to see the baby's head there, Gamble will be pleased"
114,q3fwx5_00115,"Victoria is wonderful, but she could use some Jamali-style negotiating skills here"
115,q3fwx5_00116,Time to shine for this video
116,q3fwx5_00117,Guz sexualising Alex's actions for the 2nd week running
117,q3fwx5_00118,Something just not right about Haribo adverts at this time of night
118,q3fwx5_00119,So the Troy thing must mean something....is there something inside the cow? Or inside the table?
119,q3fwx5_00120,Not what I was expecting from the new Bond tbh.
120,q3fwx5_00121,VCM spoiling no time to die
121,q3fwx5_00122,Linda!!!!
122,q3fwx5_00123,Desiree's was fucking brilliant!
123,q3fwx5_00124,"Ooh-arr, unn?"
124,q3fwx5_00125,Washed out again. Very annoying!
125,q3fwx5_00126,Alan Davies brings in a VHS of himself as Jonathan Creek.
126,q3fwx5_00127,"""Are you very close to her?"" ɐıʃɐɹʇsn∀ uı s,ǝɥS"
127,q3fwx5_00128,Are these the spooky scenes?
128,q3fwx5_00129,Last person to tie Alex like that was Rhod XD!
129,q3fwx5_00130,Real shame that we're 3 episodes in and haven't had a single one without issues yet. Mostly can't be helped and I get that but it still sucks
130,q3fwx5_00131,WHO IS GARY
131,q3fwx5_00132,"""Air shagging a church"" is going into the TM lexicon...."
132,q3fwx5_00133,USE ARCHES.
133,q3fwx5_00134,"I know we've gone over this in so my threads that Greg's scoring is subjective and that's part of the charm of TM. But his blatant favouring of Morgana in this episode really got me down like nothing else, not even Hugh getting robbed for his dance."
134,q3fwx5_00135,Ｗｅｌｃｏｍｅ ｔｏ ｔｈｅ ｗｏｒｌｄ．
135,q3fwx5_00136,Victoria is quite the artist.
136,q3fwx5_00137,Sounds like a couple of cowboys from the deep West Country.
137,q3fwx5_00138,rhod's been in the TM house again
138,q3fwx5_00139,What a way to go. Death by duckie.
139,q3fwx5_00140,Extraordinary stuff from Desiree there
140,q3fwx5_00141,"Does anyone know the filming location of this season's tasks? (The deconsecrated church and surrounding buildings I mean, not the TM house)."
141,q3fwx5_00142,"Not loving this series so far, sadly. It’s reminding me of series six - there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with it but it’s just a bit boring"
142,q3fwx5_00143,"""Strengthen the foundation with rainbows."""
143,q3fwx5_00144,I love Victoria making notes on Alex's actions
144,q3fwx5_00145,Move over salt bae...it's sand baes time! Love Guz
145,q3fwx5_00146,Alan's bridge is amazing! And Morgana is a genius!
146,q3fwx5_00147,Not Linda :(
147,q3fwx5_00148,"Ok...so is anyone elses picture kind of ""white"" again this week?"
148,q3fwx5_00149,Alex definitely gave a few hints to Morgana...but still you love to see it :)
149,q3fwx5_00150,If Guz doesn't get minimum three points (accounting for not seeing the other two) I will riot... Or at the very least be a little miffed.
150,q3fwx5_00151,Who said the line from the episode title? I missed it.
151,q3fwx5_00152,"alan is so wholesome, i can't"
152,q3fwx5_00153,Still looks pretty washed out.
153,q3fwx5_00154,"I covet that mustard yellow and black blouse Morgana is wearing. I also covet the big furry hat she's got on in the church. Impeccable fashion, extra point for Morgana!"
154,q3fwx5_00155,Love that Alex has different coloured handkerchiefs in his pockets for them all!
155,q3fwx5_00156,"To anyone who is solving or solved the taskmaster book, the banter section made a good reference to a question in it."
156,q3fwx5_00157,Did Guz just...birth that egg.
157,q3fwx5_00158,"Wonderful, Alan"
158,q3fwx5_00159,I thought Alan's was good! Come on VCM!
159,q3fwx5_00160,Did they not put the newest episode on you tube?
160,q3fwx5_00161,GARY!
161,q3fwx5_00162,I can’t be the only person who’s immediately thinking of Only Fools when he started shouting “Gary”??
162,q3fwx5_00163,This is some of the grossest-looking sand I have ever seen. Which makes me question Desiree even more!
163,q3fwx5_00164,Wonder if Greg would accept passing the egg under the whole table as it passing under the bridge - that's what I would have done!
164,q3fwx5_00165,Morganas polo neck/ tassle jumpsuit look is amazing!
165,q3fwx5_00166,"A live team task? Has this been done before? Was a legit question from someone who hasn't caught up yet, thanks for the answers."
166,q3fwx5_00167,I'm loving this season!
167,q3fwx5_00168,Is the newest episode not up on YouTube yet?
168,q3fwx5_00169,Fascinated to discover there's a bathroom just inside the front door.
169,q3fwx5_00170,This is the first task this series I genuinely think I'd smash! Or at least do better than Alan or Guz.
170,q3fwx5_00171,That might be the best intro to the ad break ever
171,q3fwx5_00172,I love Alan ha ha
172,q3fwx5_00173,"Oh shit, Rhod Gilbert is back!"
173,q3fwx5_00174,That was a wonderful studio task
174,q3fwx5_00175,How tf did VCM get herself back in time (ish)? Impressive
175,q3fwx5_00176,I love how Victoria and Alan seen to have gone for similar styles
176,q3fwx5_00177,Desiree and Alan gotta get good marks surely!
177,q3fwx5_00178,Anyone know where that Chapel was?
178,q3fwx5_00179,Morgana is going to lose this series because of her prize tasks
179,q3fwx5_00180,Morgana gives excellent invisible sock puppet hand actions lol
180,q3fwx5_00181,I really want Victoria’s nail varnish.
181,q3fwx5_00182,What is Troy?
182,q3fwx5_00183,IN the table?!?!
183,q3fwx5_00184,I don't know why noone took the boots on a bungee jump. That was my first thought anyway..
184,q3fwx5_00185,Is Gary the Gary from Hypothetical?
185,q3fwx5_00186,Ghost with a book lamp! Love it!
186,q3fwx5_00187,Okay Victoria has won me over with this task
187,q3fwx5_00188,CREEKY
188,q3fwx5_00189,"Another weird prize task, none have actually been that funny yet and from the rest of the series I know that isn't because of the people"
189,q3fwx5_00190,Desiree is a genius
190,q3fwx5_00191,"New Zealander here, man I loved the episode! Can't wait for number 3!"
191,q3fwx5_00192,A classic episode
192,q3fwx5_00193,Is Greg referring to Gary Delaney?
193,q3fwx5_00194,"What do you mean, the end of the franchise?"
194,q3fwx5_00195,
195,q3fwx5_00196,Location task!
196,q3fwx5_00197,
197,q3fwx5_00198,Oh God 😂
198,q3fwx5_00199,Dear old Alan
199,q3fwx5_00200,"“Bit late, I think…” yeah Alan, but it’s expected"
200,q3fwx5_00201,Is that mel’s voice?
201,q3fwx5_00202,"I’ve always hated being called Gary, but loved the shout out tonight lol."
202,q3fwx5_00203,Weird WII Sport coordination game be like:
203,q3fwx5_00204,I was intrigued by that show murder island....I watched episode 1...I wouldn't bother
204,q3fwx5_00205,Something seems familiar…
205,q3fwx5_00206,This is familiar
206,q3fwx5_00207,We havent seen this table in ages have we!?
207,q3fwx5_00208,Hope they all look under the table
208,q3fwx5_00209,Oh I loved the little task on this model before!
209,q3fwx5_00210,When will it be available on YouTube?
210,q3fwx5_00211,Sand bae
211,q3fwx5_00212,Can you rip up the plastic sheeting on the walls....fill with sand...tie up ends like a big sand sausage...job done?
212,q3fwx5_00213,Troy the crow?
213,q3fwx5_00214,There is some kind of clue on the bird
214,q3fwx5_00215,Guz’s egg looks like those egg heads that I grew cress in.
215,q3fwx5_00216,The timing of the ad breaks blows my mind
216,q3fwx5_00217,i don't think i'm ready for whatever morgana has built
217,q3fwx5_00218,TROY IS LIFE.
218,q3fwx5_00219,"Well, colour me spooked"
219,q3fwx5_00220,Is this Pirates of the Caribbean 6?
220,q3fwx5_00221,"Ah, so those were the spooky scenes..."
0,q3iszz_00001,Does anyone know why Canada is now blocked from watching it?
1,q3iszz_00002,Blocked countries United Kingdom Finland Norway New Zealand Canada Sweden Denmark United States Australia
2,q3iszz_00003,"I can see it if I VPN to France (I don't know, I had to pick something)"
3,q3iszz_00004,I set my VPn to France I’m watching it now
0,q86x5t_00001,Did Morgana get Guz to say submarine?
1,q86x5t_00002,"OK I don't know if they intended it but that encryption was brilliantly planned so if you know what you're doing, you don't need the puzzle at all. I've done some frequency analysis decryption before, so I tried it out and got the full riddle in about 5 minutes. The big thing is just on initial look you see the word 'GSA' a fair few times, and the most common three letter word is 'the', and seeing the GS appear at the start of other words which could be 'than' or 'that' confirms it. From there you can fill in the blanks with some small context hints, which really becomes easy when you realize the ten letter word that appears twice is 'taskmaster'. You can see how Victoria was able to get it with half the puzzle, and honestly I doubt she relied much on that anyway. I dunno if anyone on staff has any experience with this sort of thing but it was really well done, and for the first time I got to actually do the task! 10/10 best episode"
2,q86x5t_00003,"I'm very late to this episode but oh my god that was amazing. Greg's ""That's Taskmaster, and if you don't like it, tough shit"", Victoria learning to ride the bike and Guz's ""Who the fook is Veronica?"" all made it a classic for me."
3,q86x5t_00004,"I sort of thought Victoria was putting the ""I don't know what cool is"" thing on until I listened to the podcast and she asked if Mark Zuckerberg is cool."
4,q86x5t_00005,As someone who also simply never learned how to ride a bike when I was young I appreciated watching Victoria work it out. Her and Alan are really the highlights of the season for me. Love Morganna too but in a way I can’t describe it seems like it would be fun to watch her do more series 2/3 type tasks.
5,q86x5t_00006,"Why do I get the feeling that ""he once drunkenly told me his wife isn't pulling her weight with the childcare"" might actually be true ><"
6,q86x5t_00007,That riddle task must have been agonising in real time. We got the super sped up version and it was still like pulling teeth.
7,q86x5t_00008,I was at edge of my seat when Victoria was solving the puzzle haha
8,q86x5t_00009,Am I the only person who wasn't charmed by Guz in that team task? I feel like watching it regurgitated PTSD from every school group project ever. Desiree should have gotten a bonus point for carrying the team.
9,q86x5t_00010,Victoria not even needing Alan’s half of the jigsaw code is peak Victoria.
10,q86x5t_00011,I don't fear death. In fact the more this series progresses the more I long for it.
11,q86x5t_00012,I dont think ive ever seen Alex fall on the floor laughing before. I dont think we're even seeing half of the confusion that must have built up for him to do that
12,q86x5t_00013,Who the fuck is Veronica killed me
13,q86x5t_00014,"Desiree going to murder Guz if he says ""There's been a revelation in the lab"" again."
14,q86x5t_00015,Another revelation from the lab
15,q86x5t_00016,"So, all Victoria really needed from Alan in that task was making himself look like Charlie Chaplin, right? Incredible."
16,q86x5t_00017,alex dying on the floor during the team task had me wheezing
17,q86x5t_00018,"Guz saying ""who the fuck is Veronica?"" is a highlight for me"
18,q86x5t_00019,Alex looks like he’s pissing himself laughing in the corner!
19,q86x5t_00020,"""How long have I got to learn to ride a bike?"" ""One minute."""
20,q86x5t_00021,"""Surely it won't be the longest task we've ever filmed."" That's promising."
21,q86x5t_00022,Morgana is really happy Victoria wasn't last
22,q86x5t_00023,Footage of Desiree saying “fuck me in the face” and Alex falling over laughing should be sent to every scold who says swearing isn’t funny. Truly a classic episode from start to finish.
23,q86x5t_00024,That was a fucking amazing task from both sides. Victoria being amazing and the other side being an absolute dumpster fire. Lol
24,q86x5t_00025,Victoria learning to ride a bike on the spot was ironicly the coolest thing in the episode. Especially cooler than eating dirt jam toast.
25,q86x5t_00026,‘The world of the customised inhaler’ is a beautiful phrase
26,q86x5t_00027,"Morgana did a wonderful job getting them to say submarine, pure genius"
27,q86x5t_00028,Alan being pleased with himself when he got to say “copy that” on the walkie talkie is so funny.
28,q86x5t_00029,The riddle task is definitely proof that sometimes overcomplicated tasks can be absolute gold.
29,q86x5t_00030,"Absolutely certain the only reason Alex did that is because the cameramen were looking over at him, tears in their eyes, whispering please, we have families"
30,q86x5t_00031,I was about to say oh I had the same idea as Morgana and then she put Cornettos down her bra and she's completely lost me again
31,q86x5t_00032,I'm not sure Desiree got enough credit for carrying the team of three there. Victoria definitely did all of the work for the two but Alan was at least attempting to be helpful unlike Guz lmao.
32,q86x5t_00033,I need to cool down after that strut from Morgana
33,q86x5t_00034,You fucked it Guz by complimenting Alex
34,q86x5t_00035,"Got to admit, I do think Alan looked really cool ambling around the garden toting toast and a leafblower"
35,q86x5t_00036,Guz ‘cheating’ at the end and still didn’t get a single one in from it 😂
36,q86x5t_00037,Watching VCM learn to ride a bike in real time is an Experience.
37,q86x5t_00038,"I think we are all overlooking the fact that VCM ate dirt on television tonight, what an absolute daredevil."
38,q86x5t_00039,I love Greg going off on people complaining about his scoring
39,q86x5t_00040,"If I had a nickel for every time a contestant ate dirt in this series, I'd have 2 nickels. Which, isn't a lot, but it's kinda weird that it happened twice in 2 episodes"
40,q86x5t_00041,"I want Victoria to be my mum, my best friend, and my wife."
41,q86x5t_00042,"This has to be the best cast we've seen in a while, right? That team task was perfection."
42,q86x5t_00043,"Guz should be glad he wasn't on a team with Daisy or Ed, lol"
43,q86x5t_00044,"I never thought I would see Victoria Coren Mitchell go ""WHEEEEE"" on a tiny bike, but I'm very glad I did, absolute highlight of 2021 right there"
44,q86x5t_00045,Initial thought: VCM telling Alan to wait because she almost figured out the cipher not realizing Alan could contribute shows how long we've come from Liza suggesting hops to the Asim/Tim and doing it herself out of spite. Haha. I also really like how we're getting genuine reactions from Alex/Greg during the scripted studio banter/breaks.
45,q86x5t_00046,"Victoria solving the code with only half a cipher, she deserves like 2 bonus points (minus 1 for ignoring Alan)."
46,q86x5t_00047,Victoria continuing to ride all proud of her new skill is so adorable
47,q86x5t_00048,I have to assume Channel 4 vetoed 'Square Titted Toast Woman' as a title because otherwise how can it not be the title
48,q86x5t_00049,They really broke Victoria down to nothing and then built her back up again in this episode huh
49,q86x5t_00050,Guz being in the lab really fucked this group over
50,q86x5t_00051,Is this the start of Victorias comeback?
51,q86x5t_00052,Alex going from despair to corpsing to despair again.... 🤣
52,q86x5t_00053,"Anyone else want to watch the full unabridged version of Desiree, Guz and Morgana's task? Also did Morgana get Desiree to say submarine and then twiddled her thumbs for 90 minutes? Wish I could be paid to do that..."
53,q86x5t_00054,Victoria deserves a bonus point
54,q86x5t_00055,I was wondering earlier “we haven’t seen a good team task in a bit.” That cleared that up for me 😂
55,q86x5t_00056,I’ve never seen a worse looking lasagna.
56,q86x5t_00057,the amount of charisma and charm that Morgana has is so entertaining
57,q86x5t_00058,"Morgana has the coolest energy, I feel like my life would be so much better and more exciting if I knew her"
58,q86x5t_00059,"Victoria is trying to think laterally instead of going Route 1 for the prize tasks (aside from the Tippex one), and it's sad that others aren't loving her attempts as much as I am :( Also, holy crap she learnt to ride a bike in 1 minute! I mean, sure, Alan won this ep, but for all intents and purposes this is Victoria's ep"
59,q86x5t_00060,Hey everyone there's been another revelation. Gus is one of my favourite contestants ever just for that task hahahaah. The fact that he was so bad they had to take his clues from him and he just started playing guitar and singing hahaha. Incredible.
60,q86x5t_00061,"This task reminds me so much of David Correos in the caravan escape room, just because of the mental breakdowns they’re all having."
61,q86x5t_00062,Victoria never have learned to ride a bike might be as iconic as the potato of Joe
62,q86x5t_00063,Just want to add when Morgana stood up and spun after winning the fork task she looked incredible.
63,q86x5t_00064,I swear the nerdier Victoria is the more attractive to me she becomes.
64,q86x5t_00065,"I loved seeing Alex cracking up during the group task. Considering what a lovable guy he is, I can't imagine anything more irritating than an hour of Guz Khan announcing revelations, getting distracted, not making his puzzle, and then getting confused by phonetic alphabets. Absolutely glorious task."
65,q86x5t_00066,"Surprised the episode isn't called ""There's been another revelation"", possibly my favourite TM quote of all time haha."
66,q86x5t_00067,"Gotta say that solo task was the easiest in TM history. Imagine if Morgana’s task was to sabotage the others? They’d still be there. If I were given the “look cool spreading jam”, task, I’d ask if they could green screen me walking away from an explosion while spreading jam like in an action movie that somehow involved toast. Victoria learning to ride a bike surely deserved a bonus point."
67,q86x5t_00068,"I love that the ""The Knappett"" Sign is still there!"
68,q86x5t_00069,"""That does make you quite cool, being friends with the children."""
69,q86x5t_00070,"Well, that's two more for the book of quotes: ""Who the fuck is Veronica?"" and ""I don't fear death. In fact the longer this series goes on, the more I yearn for it."" Peak Victoria. Also, as a huge fan of Alan on QI I just knew he was going to put the jam in the leaf blower. Peak Alan."
70,q86x5t_00071,"when Alan rang his little bell and said ""thats cool!"", I roared - a wild sound escaped my body, sound I have never ever heard - I am forever thankful, I am convinced all my demons left my body with this one mighty laugh also, Guz didnt single-handedly changed the game, he used two hands, and looked like a brave warrior during it!"
71,q86x5t_00072,I liked Victoria realising that if 3rd place had 6 forks and she had 7 there was no way she had won.
72,q86x5t_00073,Taaaaskmaster's oooooon. Iiiiiit is on nooooooow.
73,q86x5t_00074,"I actually feel a bit sorry for Alan here. He's smart, but VCM just left him in the dust."
74,q86x5t_00075,"Morgana’s walk at the end is so cool, if only she did that for jam spreading!! Victoria Resurgence starts! Last to second!!"
75,q86x5t_00076,Morgana looking exquisite at the end there
76,q86x5t_00077,"Desiree absolutely ROCKING that hot pink suit, whatta woman."
77,q86x5t_00078,I love that Victoria went for the layers pun
78,q86x5t_00079,"Solving a riddle? Oh, this task was made for Victoria."
79,q86x5t_00080,The Alex banter and ad intros are on top form tonight
80,q86x5t_00081,"god this team task is everything, im losing it"
81,q86x5t_00082,"Ok how come Morgana didn't argue that she interpreted ""cool"" in the toast task to mean ""cold"" since all her stuff was frozen?"
82,q86x5t_00083,I reckon we’ve all collectively fallen in love with Victoria.
83,q86x5t_00084,"""It's very much a task drawn from the world of the customised inhaler"" is the best TM quote ever and I'm not exaggerating"
84,q86x5t_00085,Praise for Alex is a disastrous tactic by Guz
85,q86x5t_00086,"In a very short time we've had Guz praying in a church, Guz doing a Christ pose, and this week it's ""Revelations"" If he dies next episode don't be too shocked til episode 8."
86,q86x5t_00087,Watching Victoria smash this task is very sexy.
87,q86x5t_00088,Victoria is doing surprisingly well for someone who doesn't know how to ride a bike
88,q86x5t_00089,One day I hope I can say ‘I now look like Charlie Chaplin’ into a walkie talkie
89,q86x5t_00090,"If anyone liked that Riddle task go check out the escape room ""eat the grape"" task from Taskmaster NZ. One of the contestants has a similar to Gus horrific attempt and it is incredible."
90,q86x5t_00091,
91,q86x5t_00092,I am so endeared by Victoria learning to ride her bike. Look how happy she is!
92,q86x5t_00093,I want to see a VCM v Charlotte Ritchie bike race.
93,q86x5t_00094,We're four episodes in and every episode has had a different winner. I would absolutely love for VCM to win the next one.
94,q86x5t_00095,"Stray thoughts & observations: This may have been my favourite opening 5 minutes of any episode ever. I would love, just once, for Guz to call me ""brootha"". I absolutely loved his stories about the way the school children abused the other teachers Really happy that VCM finally got a chance to use that big ol' brain of hers in the team task, there haven't been many tasks this series that ay to her skills. My crush on Morgana seems to grow significantly every episode, and has surpassed Sally Phillips. I suspect that Greg feels the same. I've been pleasantly surprised by Desiree. I was a bit worried when it was announced that she would be a bit over the top, but I've really enjoyed her."
95,q86x5t_00096,Victoria customising her inhaler with stickers is precious.
96,q86x5t_00097,This was the best episode of the season so far for me. Victoria learning to ride a bike (and actually doing quite well by the end of the task) was nice to see and hilarious. Then her doing all the work in the team task as the other team took hours and Desiree getting increasingly annoyed with Guz. The jam and live tasks were great too.
97,q86x5t_00098,Thursday is best day of the week. Also isn’t next episode 100th ep of Taskmaster? Super excited!!
98,q86x5t_00099,"I don’t know why seeing Morgana shoving frozen peas down her bra feels right, but it just does."
99,q86x5t_00100,What did we learn today? The audio got fucked in the YT upload :(
100,q86x5t_00101,I love that Morgana explained she liked eating her vegetable lasagne in the dark also “There’s no meat in it cuz I’m saving the planet”
101,q86x5t_00102,ALL RIM AND BOUNCE
102,q86x5t_00103,"The other group are gonna be awful aren't they, haha"
103,q86x5t_00104,This whole series is just making me want to marry Morgana!
104,q86x5t_00105,Easily one of my favorite episodes of Taskmaster ever. VCM literally looked like a little kid when she was attempting to ride the bike lol.
105,q86x5t_00106,Fuck me in the face
106,q86x5t_00107,VICTORIA DID WELL YAY
107,q86x5t_00108,Bucket of forks task was a callback to Desiree surely?
108,q86x5t_00109,"Oh poor Victoria, that’s so cruel that she has to ride the bike"
109,q86x5t_00110,"I am so pleased to see Taskmaster back to its peak, I didnt enjoy series 10 despite the guests being pretty good. Series 11 was great and a huge improvement and now series 12 is looking like being one of the best (tied with series 5 for me!). Every week I have been proper laughing!"
110,q86x5t_00111,Me watching Morgana putting peas down her bra during her cool task
111,q86x5t_00112,My god that riddle task will go down in history. Second favourite task from the whole show.
112,q86x5t_00113,Oh no! Victoria said that she was embarrassed about the tasks in this episode but now I understand!
113,q86x5t_00114,Alex has lost it 😂
114,q86x5t_00115,the greatest part about this series is that every contestant would be a fifth placer in other series and it's glorious.
115,q86x5t_00116,"Love the team riddle task! Really enjoyed the contrast between the teams on it. Victoria just in her element was wonderful, even if Alan could've helped a lil!"
116,q86x5t_00117,"Victoria is unsurprisingly, fantastic at riddles"
117,q86x5t_00118,Oh to be in Alex's shoes sitting with Desiree...
118,q86x5t_00119,I just realised. There’s a bell and an orange on the table “Nothing” rhymes with orange
119,q86x5t_00120,Look at Alex having to deal with them.
120,q86x5t_00121,Alex is completely loosing it. I love it!
121,q86x5t_00122,
122,q86x5t_00123,"Given that you could actually feel the dread seeping from Victoria C-Ms' tweet about this episode earlier, I have high hopes for quality shenanigans and mockery from Greg tonight."
123,q86x5t_00124,God I love brutal Greg
124,q86x5t_00125,Bwhahaha fuck me in the face indeed.
125,q86x5t_00126,If Morgana and guz swapped where they were they would've been far faster
126,q86x5t_00127,"The contestants were saying they were frustrated like hell by the riddle task (although that might just be the one team), while I'm looking at it wishing I could do something like that with my family or friends."
127,q86x5t_00128,Hour amounting to nothing is Desiree’s peak!
128,q86x5t_00129,Alan looks so happy ♥️
129,q86x5t_00130,"I can't believe that Victoria, despite learning to ride a bicycle one minute before the task began didn't come last! I like to imagine I'd have been smart enough to either grab something I could lean on at each of the smaller tasks, or accepted I was going to need to stop at each one, once. I think they did remove the kickstands, so no chance to use that... I really felt for Desiree in the puzzle task. I think I would have snapped about halfway through. That was one where I'd have been inclined to split the points, giving Guz one, Desiree and Morgana two. I might have even split them for the other group, though despite the jokes, Alan actually was quite helpful, it was just that Victoria was racing ahead."
130,q86x5t_00131,Why not just ride up and down the whole length then do a task every now and again?
131,q86x5t_00132,Anyone got some stickers I can put on my inhaler? I wanna be cool like Victoria.
132,q86x5t_00133,What a great way to use covid social distancing!
133,q86x5t_00134,"We’ve seen Greg force Alex to eat edible prizes in the past, but even he won’t subject Alex to the state that is that lasagna."
134,q86x5t_00135,Morgana managed her deficit in the last two tasks
135,q86x5t_00136,Was the only person that thought Desiree rocked the Charlie Chaplin look? She looked cool. And unlike Greg…don’t @ me.
136,q86x5t_00137,She's too cute. For somebody who can't cycle she's doing a bloody good job.
137,q86x5t_00138,"""probably not"" - GUZ NO"
138,q86x5t_00139,I thought the blower spreading the jam made Alan cooler
139,q86x5t_00140,Customising your own inhaler is clearly peak cool
140,q86x5t_00141,"Alan Davies when saying ""copy that"" just"
141,q86x5t_00142,"Think series 12 has finally hit its stride, best episode yet"
142,q86x5t_00143,"Greetings to everyone in Asia who woke up to watch Taskmaster, or people in NA/SA who is probably watching the show over dinner or at night"
143,q86x5t_00144,Where is Morgana's dress from? It's amazing and I need it.
144,q86x5t_00145,I think I'm in love with Morgana just a little bit
145,q86x5t_00146,Task: Spread jam on toast. Desiree: Spread jam on caravan.
146,q86x5t_00147,Guz continues being absolutely adorable.
147,q86x5t_00148,Sand and dirt have both been eaten this series.
148,q86x5t_00149,That was brilliant from Victoria
149,q86x5t_00150,I just realised the music when Victoria rode the bike (when she was putting the post into the mailbox) is the same one when Phil made his beautiful noise
150,q86x5t_00151,At the end did Guz just stop spinning and throw them back to back?
151,q86x5t_00152,VCM you are a treasure
152,q86x5t_00153,"Didn’t think I’d be thinking a bag of frozen peas was sexy tonight, but thank you Morgana"
153,q86x5t_00154,Victoria is the MVP of this episode
154,q86x5t_00155,Victoria making that look like a walk in the park. I would look like an idiot.
155,q86x5t_00156,Greg just murdered us all...
156,q86x5t_00157,Greg is too self aware of us XD
157,q86x5t_00158,"This series has gone a bit too heavy on the 'go pro attached to the helmet' tasks, I don't love that addition"
158,q86x5t_00159,Popping the task out of the toaster was wonderful
159,q86x5t_00160,Nothing is greater than taskmaster. Athlete in her prime
160,q86x5t_00161,While Morgana is my favourite they are all adding so much to the series already Also they seem so close to one another as friends (almost as close as TMNZ series 2)
161,q86x5t_00162,"That bike task, absolutely no-one gave it any real thought. Yes, a few of them walked the course first. No-one spotted the easy way of not only taking the longest but not putting your feet down. Because they were all facing the objects, nobody thought to zig-zig up the course which would have won easily. Pick up red balloon & burst it in the bucket - zigag method would have allowed you to stop & rest on the plinth, take the CORRECT balloon then move on. Also, I didn't hear any rules which said you couldn't stop, only not putting feet down. Take hat from dummy, put on 2nd dummy - again, another chance to stop, hand on dummy's shoulder as long as you like. You could spend several minutes here without putting a foot down. Place hat on dummy, take letter, read it & post it - Yet another chance to stop & rest. Hand on dummys shoulder, place hat on it's head, remove & read letter for further instructions, wait as long as you want before moving on. Post letter while saying ""I am a speedy cylist"" - Again, another chance to stop, rest on the mail box for as long as you want before posting the letter. I feel they missed a trick on the live task as well, nothing in the rules said you coudn't throw more than 1 fork at a time."
162,q86x5t_00163,This episode had my favorite tasks of the season so far! The toast one they all went wildly different directions which was so interesting to watch and the riddle task was like an escape room which was fun!
163,q86x5t_00164,"I'm slightly disappointed that no-one realised that they should just cycle slowly, ignoring the tasks and get the minimum 3 halvings. Then again, there's a reason I'm not a comedian."
164,q86x5t_00165,"Morgana is braver than me, putting ice into her bra!"
165,q86x5t_00166,
166,q86x5t_00167,Alex is loving the team of 3's attempt
167,q86x5t_00168,Absolutely loving everything about this riddle task.
168,q86x5t_00169,"Watching it now, surely the bike tasks you could just put one foot on the ground and move the bike like that, finish all the objectives bar one and then just get back on the bike cycle around for 20 minutes and finish the last one? Desiree moved a fair distance with her foot when she placed it on the ground the first time and didn’t get penalised"
169,q86x5t_00170,Victoria not knowing how to ride a bike is precious.
170,q86x5t_00171,"God, Desiree’s studio outfit is stunning."
171,q86x5t_00172,That was actually cool from Alan
172,q86x5t_00173,Two quiz show GOATS right here
173,q86x5t_00174,"Second A+ episode this series, and it was even funnier than the first (episode 2). I feel like I guffawed once per minute, at least."
174,q86x5t_00175,I miss the live studio audiences. IMO the show suffers badly without them.
175,q86x5t_00176,A casual disregard for your health is cool.
176,q86x5t_00177,I think that has to be one of the biggest insults to Alex Greg's introduction has given
177,q86x5t_00178,"I love the little task starting gun, so cute"
178,q86x5t_00179,No one told Victoria about the brakes 😅
179,q86x5t_00180,Can't believe I wasn't that excited by this lineup. Guz has been particularly entertaining
180,q86x5t_00181,Morgana's trying to make the same kind of joke that VCM did in the prize task... because that went well.
181,q86x5t_00182,Great episode! The riddle and Victoria not knowing how to ride the bike was incredible.
182,q86x5t_00183,
183,q86x5t_00184,This is such a relaxing show. I might start on the NZ version now.
184,q86x5t_00185,Is the colour saturation off again?
185,q86x5t_00186,Best thing with lots of layers? Three words: Tunnock's Caramel Wafer.
186,q86x5t_00187,Victoria is doing quite well for having never cycled before now!
187,q86x5t_00188,It's weird riding a bike again as an adult if you haven't done it in awhile since you were a kid. Really let me know I got old as fuck and out of shape lol
188,q86x5t_00189,That cake looks dreadful and Greg didn't even comment!
189,q86x5t_00190,Now I know why She is guest this week.
190,q86x5t_00191,"If it wasnt for covid I think Greg would have been taking Alex for one of his classic back of the stage talkings to for calling him a ""cheeky cow""."
191,q86x5t_00192,Desiree is so fabulous tonight omg
192,q86x5t_00193,"Did anyone else thought of Seinfeld when Morgana said ""vegetable lasagna""?"
193,q86x5t_00194,"Thinking about Victoria and the bike riding, I wonder if they'd have spared Roisin the horse riding these days? I suppose some of that depends on whether she was just reluctant or really had a phobia."
194,q86x5t_00195,What a chaotic start!! 😂
195,q86x5t_00196,"""Alex, have you been sticking tasks in the toaster again?"""
196,q86x5t_00197,Fuck this task is brilliant.
197,q86x5t_00198,Best thing with lots of layers? Onion.
198,q86x5t_00199,I'M ONE
199,q86x5t_00200,Someone should have brought an onion.
200,q86x5t_00201,Longest time? Ride the course normally but just do loops for each one?
201,q86x5t_00202,"Could you use the five minutes to manipulate the course, so like, placing things on the ground that you can rest your feet on or moving them apart so they're further away? (I say, knowing full well I have Victoria's problem.)"
202,q86x5t_00203,I'm finding it hard to believe this is the first time she's ever ridden a bike. Surely nobody takes to it that quickly?! I'm assuming Alex was training her by holding onto the back like a classic dad.
203,q86x5t_00204,"Never thought I'd find myself jealous of a pack of frozen peas at any point in my life, but here we are."
204,q86x5t_00205,“Down With Capitalism” marry me Desiree.
205,q86x5t_00206,Feel like Alex would have been attacked by Greg if it wasn't thanks to social distancing XD
206,q86x5t_00207,Quick start selling inhaler customisation kits on etsy.
207,q86x5t_00208,The proper etiquette with riddles made me laugh
208,q86x5t_00209,This is like me whizzing through the Missing Vowels round on OC
209,q86x5t_00210,Probably not hahahahahaha
210,q86x5t_00211,Looks like TM UK added a leafblower to the shed after seeing the fun it added to TM NZ
211,q86x5t_00212,I’m gonna have ‘he’s just a man’ stuck in my a head all night
212,q86x5t_00213,It seems like they have been unkind with the bike sizes here
213,q86x5t_00214,I can't really ride a bike either
214,q86x5t_00215,Disappointed nobody made puff pastry.
215,q86x5t_00216,Ah I thought the lab was the room with the desk but just changed around for each task. I guess they must be separate rooms Edit - ah well that answer that
216,q86x5t_00217,This escape room team would have been blown up by the moustachioed villain.
217,q86x5t_00218,Does anyone know where the bike task was set? It looked familiar but I couldn't figure out where and can't read the credits
218,q86x5t_00219,Just a man called Greg.
219,q86x5t_00220,If eggsactly actually gets more points than layers as a pun then I'm going to freak out
220,q86x5t_00221,A season 10-esque batch of prize tasks so far
221,q86x5t_00222,"I can’t remember, did the task specify you had to do all that stuff while on the bike?"
222,q86x5t_00223,
223,q86x5t_00224,"I would join in with the task, but the only jam I have is a jar of raspberry and chia seed jam that cost like 4 quid"
224,q86x5t_00225,It seems there's been more tits this series than previous ones.
225,q86x5t_00226,Guz and Morgana bullying Alex is valid.
226,q86x5t_00227,"Jesus, they actually looked professional!"
227,q86x5t_00228,I might be thick as rocks but at least I can ride a bike
228,q86x5t_00229,Oof washed out white/grey looking filter..
229,q86x5t_00230,"this is fast approaching ""things beginning with G"" levels"
230,q86x5t_00231,I'm in tears already
231,q86x5t_00232,I’m loving the tasks set in the deconsecrated church. The aesthetic is incredible.
232,q86x5t_00233,I wonder if Victoria will complete the task with Alex holding on to the back of the saddle
233,q86x5t_00234,God I love Vicky. What a treat.
234,q86x5t_00235,Does anybody have access to a copy without the throwing to breaks cut out?
235,q86x5t_00236,"Shocking pun from Victoria, awful"
236,q86x5t_00237,Helmet cam always leads to good stuff
237,q86x5t_00238,I would love this task. I track stand on my bike at traffic lights all the time
238,q86x5t_00239,"I can't ride a bike either, I'd be fucked"
239,q86x5t_00240,What is Morgana?!! I can’t seem to find an answer!
240,q86x5t_00241,Oh my fucking God 😂
241,q86x5t_00242,"I learned to ride a bike when I was like... 10 because my parents promised they'd get me a PS2 if I did. I've played a lot of PlayStation in my life but not gotten on a bike since then, so I'm pretty sure I'd be about as good as Victoria at this one."
242,q86x5t_00243,HOOK IT INTO MY VEINS
243,q86x5t_00244,

0,q88xq2_00001,“Fuck me in the face.” - Desiree Burch
1,q88xq2_00002,The sound cut out at 44:11 then came back at the end with the recording of Alex that always comes at the end.
2,q88xq2_00003,Blocked countries United Kingdom Finland Norway New Zealand Canada Sweden Denmark United States Australia
3,q88xq2_00004,Canada and censored version news: https://twitter.com/AlexHorne/status/1447650209434062859
4,q88xq2_00005,What about us Americans?
0,qczgk0_00001,Watching Victoria watch that ball was painful. I thought she'd had a great idea. It's too bad Alex decided to transform in David Beckham or something. I also think this is one of the few task I've seen Alex get a little personal in. Like with Guz and Morgana. Dude pulled out scissors.
1,qczgk0_00002,no one tied up Alex for the soccer task and i am disappointed
2,qczgk0_00003,What is a “flapjack”?I’m in the US and I have only heard it’s referred to as a pancake.
3,qczgk0_00004,Yelling at my phone “stop throwing darts!”
4,qczgk0_00005,"I think this is one of my favourite episodes. The studio task was amazing, as was the football task. Zero points for both on the team task is iconic, and Alan being so utterly useless at throwing balls."
5,qczgk0_00006,"I’ve joked about someone in production designing the tasks to satisfy their odd fetishes a couple of seasons ago but this episode I guess they just went all the way, cake sitting is literally a fetish thing haha"
6,qczgk0_00007,Alan and Alex are just two dad's who are continuing to play while their kids have gone in
7,qczgk0_00008,Awww Alex wanted to have a little go at a task himself
8,qczgk0_00009,BEST. LIVE. TASK. EVER!!
9,qczgk0_00010,"""I'm no expert, Morgana, but I'm fairly certain there's a market for that video."" This sub: Yes."
10,qczgk0_00011,Victoria's deadpan 'this is madness' 😂
11,qczgk0_00012,You don't often see Alex getting to be the creative one. This really is a special episode.
12,qczgk0_00013,Tie. Him. Up. Straight out of the Rhod Gilbert school of task solving
13,qczgk0_00014,This is the first time where I felt like Alex was the main character of an episode. So many good moments from him! All of his little ows each time Alan hit him with a ball. Basically solving tasks himself by figuring out how to get goals and being brilliant. You could see how shocked everyone was that Alex actually engaged and worked around obstacles like a real boy. Love love love.
14,qczgk0_00015,"Hearing Victoria, the poker player, saying ""This is madness, think it through Guz""..."
15,qczgk0_00016,I really wish they hid the cake in the washing machine to pay homage to Noel's cake destruction
16,qczgk0_00017,Thank fuck there was no studio audience the way Morgana is throwing them darts.
17,qczgk0_00018,"Newest entry in the Taskmaster Book of Quotes: ""Shall I leave?"" ""Do stay in the studio."""
18,qczgk0_00019,Oh fuck you if that’s the right answer hahahahaha I love Desiree.
19,qczgk0_00020,Al Murray is in a Taskmaster ad? With his track record I bet he paid for it.
20,qczgk0_00021,I like that Alex's shirt number is 12. He's not even got the confidence to not be a substitute on his own game
21,qczgk0_00022,"“I should have stood in the goal, shouldn’t I?” Me and Victoria have the same knowledge of football."
22,qczgk0_00023,Just realised that he reason no-one tied Alex up in the football task was because of social distancing. Sad to think we won't get any Alex bondage this series ☹
23,qczgk0_00024,-128 seems normal for Alan. Lol
24,qczgk0_00025,Best studio task ever imo. Not since the Knappett incident have I been so enthralled
25,qczgk0_00026,"To quote Richard Osman, ""this is like when the three Doctor Whos met."""
26,qczgk0_00027,"Victoria: I always carry flapjacks in my bag Me, an Off Menu listener: Yes that makes 100% perfect sense"
27,qczgk0_00028,NEVER would I have had Alex to say croissants is croissants
28,qczgk0_00029,Anyone want to get 100 balloons and a shitload of darts and give this a go?
29,qczgk0_00030,"Al Murray literally cannot stay away. It probably wasn't even planned to use him, but he was walking past and thought ""yeah, that looks like a laugh"""
30,qczgk0_00031,“How did you do that!” “I kicked it over it” £100 please.
31,qczgk0_00032,That studio task was genuinely one of the tensest moments I've ever seen on TV
32,qczgk0_00033,"""I have a huge amount of affection for the short-necked ballet giraffe."" What a sentence"
33,qczgk0_00034,"""You arsehole"" Morgana finally saying what many contestants have thought over the last few years"
34,qczgk0_00035,"""Everything that's not meat or vegetables is a cake"" is the best quote of this series all the time"
35,qczgk0_00036,Are those balls not between the first and middle person??
36,qczgk0_00037,"Is this a reverse task episode? Sit on a cake seems like Lisa's famous task I'm sure there was a 'catch the balls of a certain colour' task Also the don't score a goal, best celebration wins ... or am I reading too much into this?"
37,qczgk0_00038,Last December someone took a photo over the fence of Morgana doing the football task: https://www.instagram.com/p/CIlUFiMFbqG/
38,qczgk0_00039,SHIT! ALEX REVERSED UNO’D GUZ THERE.
39,qczgk0_00040,"This episode was clearly Alex's revenge on everyone but Greg. Prize task was all about praising Greg, as he deserves to be praised. Elegant man. Contestants have to sit on cakes, clear revenge for him having to sit on one. Balls-in-net was clearly a trap for people who tried to be clever Score a goal was clearly set up so he could finally play directly against the contestants and defeat them all Almost totally random live task that would take forever and have an outsize final prize as revenge on the commentators who still complain about rabbits in a hat. Well played Alex, and well deserved revenge after a hundred episodes of punishment! The above is mostly joking. More seriously, I like to think I would have been clever enough to either pop the soccer ball, or lock Alex somewhere in the soccer task. With the balls-in-net task I almost certainly would have fallen for it like the team of two, but perhaps passing the balls down still in their box would have been better? At the same time, I really think like Alex should have tried harder to dodge the balls. If they'd had a third teammate, he'd have tried to dodge. Poor Morgana, that one escaped ball..."
40,qczgk0_00041,This deserves an editing award.
41,qczgk0_00042,“What a magnificently futile use of our mortal life span.” Victoria is who Nietzsche would be as a contestant.
42,qczgk0_00043,The music that accompanied the live task make the task even more better. The task was a lot of fun and suspenseful. Also Greg’s buildup about wanting to say this phrase on tv forever only for it to be “Lovely Darts” was hilarious.
43,qczgk0_00044,"Alex gave me big ""Heeeeeres Johnny"" vibes busting through the front door"
44,qczgk0_00045,He just won’t admit he’s not on the show anymore won’t he!
45,qczgk0_00046,I love that Alex is so involved in the tasks this episode.
46,qczgk0_00047,This season is so close. I could have sworn Desiree was just leading the scoreboard and now she is in 4th place!
47,qczgk0_00048,Alex is channelling Icarus tonight back chatting Greg.
48,qczgk0_00049,VCM is the aunt that takes games too seriously yet is crap at all of them.
49,qczgk0_00050,That was the most intense bit of sport I've watched in a long time. Knowing there were ten point on offer added to the excitement
50,qczgk0_00051,Victoria owes Alex £100.
51,qczgk0_00052,"Okay, that may have been the best live task they've ever had."
52,qczgk0_00053,Feel like Victoria is just obsessed with the Mr. Men.
53,qczgk0_00054,"I want to play this game. As either Alex or contestant, I don't care."
54,qczgk0_00055,"Victoria has my sort of P.E ability ""Should I have stood in the goal?"""
55,qczgk0_00056,"Ah, clingfilm, that notoriously sturdy material."
56,qczgk0_00057,"I love how Morgana called out the ""Secret Cake Room"" even though she didn't find it! (But we got treated to the strangest version of Bake Off that I've ever seen!) Also wow, lots of bonus points up for grabs in this 100th episode! (5 for the cake, 10 for the live task!)"
57,qczgk0_00058,"The series is so good for me. Just feels very good/cozy. Victoria is undoubtedly one of my favorite contestants in the whole show, just very magnetic to watch. She has such a unique perspective but one that I always feel like I… kind of get..? The cake task is a great throwback to series 6 though, and a good way to celebrate the anniversary. Overall, I’m just very glad Taskmaster exists."
58,qczgk0_00059,"the more I watch this series, the more I'm convinced that Victoria Coren-Mitchell would be the ideal successor to the Taskmaster. if, for whatever reason, the producers have to search for a replacement for Greg Davies, they wouldn't have to look further than her."
59,qczgk0_00060,Here’s to 100 more episodes of this lunacy!
60,qczgk0_00061,Morgana seems like the kind of person that looks dramatically glamorous when she's putting the bins out.
61,qczgk0_00062,The music editing on this live task is IMPECCABLE
62,qczgk0_00063,Im surprised no one pulled a rhod gilbert and just tied alex up so he couldnt kick the ball
63,qczgk0_00064,"Honestly if they want to do Taskmaster ads like this more often, I'd be okay with that."
64,qczgk0_00065,I want a secret cake room.
65,qczgk0_00066,That is a startlingly good cake for something that was mixed by pulverizing the ingredients in a food processor
66,qczgk0_00067,"10 points to whoever did the editing on that final task, that was fantastic"
67,qczgk0_00068,Victoria saying what we were all thinking regarding the Greg/Alex relationship there
68,qczgk0_00069,"What ""just in case"" scenarios is Victoria imagining that a flapjack will help"
69,qczgk0_00070,"PE really wasn’t VCM’s thing, was it…"
70,qczgk0_00071,"Part of me was hoping that the secret cake hidden on the premises would be in the washing machine, as a little reference to the “most beautiful destruction” task from S4E1"
71,qczgk0_00072,The music and editing for this is amazing
72,qczgk0_00073,Alex having them sit on a cake was his way of telling them he loves them in the most meaningful way
73,qczgk0_00074,That painting of Guz is fucking incredible.
74,qczgk0_00075,"Loved how the scene transition shorts were all mashups of shots and Greg portraits from previous seasons, the music too."
75,qczgk0_00076,"The editing on the live task was a thing of beauty. The music was great, yes, but the cuts between contestants' throws, slow-mo that kept you guessing if it was a good or bad balloon, Greg's commentary, and Morgana just being Morgana. Amazing."
76,qczgk0_00077,“Please bring the hedgehog to the table”
77,qczgk0_00078,That was almost a heartwarming ending.
78,qczgk0_00079,Who else wanted to tie Alex up so he couldn't score a goal?! The whole episode was fantastic. Way to celebrate 100! That final task was hilarious and that music was perfection (props to whoever picked that!) And the Google Translate commercial with Desiree and Al Murray. I'll watch commercials all day long if they are task based!
79,qczgk0_00080,Cake task: My first thought was that it was going to be in the shid My second thought was to wonder whether the Taskmaster house had urinal cakes I would not have done very well at that task
80,qczgk0_00081,"Guz may have won the prize tonight for the most ridiculously unnecessary continuation of a task of all time here. That one round when he kept going with the darts, I'm thinking, dude!! With the lead you already have, the number of balloons that Morgana would then have to hit all in a row but w/o one of them being the doozy, those are just astronomical odds by then. hell, I kinda even think if Greg hadn't openly made the remark ""I'm thinking it's one and done here, it's gotta be"", to sort of directly call out Guz's stupidity, he would've done at least one more toss in that round lol which btw, Alex's ""you're sounding outside your head, too"" where it even made Greg himself crack up at realizing what he'd said, that was perfection"
81,qczgk0_00082,"Ironically if Morgana just moved the box behind her, she would have got the team a solid 99 points in the ball task, as it would not be between Her and Guz."
82,qczgk0_00083,That was a worthy episode for number 100. The live task miiiight have just become my favourite. Legit tension.
83,qczgk0_00084,"Desiree was robbed on the prize task, that gardenia was gorgeous and the other ones sucked lol"
84,qczgk0_00085,Finally! An instance where knowing how to make a microwave mug cake is handy!
85,qczgk0_00086,Hahaha! From genius to completely shut down so fast!
86,qczgk0_00087,Guz doing a reverse Rhod Gilbert.
87,qczgk0_00088,That entire episode was gloriously chaotic
88,qczgk0_00089,"Alex, your kinks are showing again"
89,qczgk0_00090,that darts game was perfect.
90,qczgk0_00091,Wait wait wait... NO ONE scored anything? Amazing.
91,qczgk0_00092,"Morgana kicking down the fence every time Alex tried to prop the goal up is now one of my favorite moments in the show. Guz's attempt was utterly fantastic, too."
92,qczgk0_00093,"Besides the prize task, one of the best episodes ever IMHO. The cake task was hilarious. Desiree falling off the cake, Morgana baking a cake, VCM just having a flapjack handy like it makes complete sense, guz was hilarious. Alex is lucky Al Murray wasn't doin the football task though. The spot would've got put in a cab never to be see again. Every contestant was entertaining in their own way and props to Alex as he was fantastic in his tenacity to score. Studio task was genuinely great viewing."
93,qczgk0_00094,VCM's mind is...just amazing
94,qczgk0_00095,Someone needs to do a Rhod Gilbert
95,qczgk0_00096,There's something oddly arousing about watching Morgana wildly throwing darts
96,qczgk0_00097,I really hope Victoria can catch up
97,qczgk0_00098,Was convinced the prevent Alex scoring a goal would be along the lines of Rhod trying up up. Hand cuff him to something away from the ball.
98,qczgk0_00099,Morgana needs stop making every task so sexy 😂
99,qczgk0_00100,"It bothered me a lot that no one made reference to when Alex sat on a cake. Either the contestants aren't a fan of this show or it got edited out or something. Was totally expecting someone to drop trou and just feel it enter them. Desiree did amazing though; with the way it was phrased, you had to expect that there was some sort of trick to the task. I really enjoyed Guz trying to keep Alex out of the Taskmaster house. It really does feel like the first time Alex ""fought"" back against the contestants. And the dart roulette was compelling and competitive. Very fun episode, overall. Can't believe I've watched 100 episodes of this, and I would easily do it again."
100,qczgk0_00101,Another hugely satisfying twist to a task the contestants thought they'd done well at. I live for those moments.
101,qczgk0_00102,10 points is insane
102,qczgk0_00103,This music 😂
103,qczgk0_00104,Well done to the editors that was fantastic
104,qczgk0_00105,Second only to horse or laminator.
105,qczgk0_00106,This task is amazing
106,qczgk0_00107,"It's funny, I wouldn't say any of these contestants are my favorite individually, but altogether I find it being one of my favorite groups."
107,qczgk0_00108,Alex got a cake sitting kink from when he had to sit on one I think.
108,qczgk0_00109,
109,qczgk0_00110,I would have just cut the football up. I am suprised no contestant tried this.
110,qczgk0_00111,Well I didn't get anything done I needed to in that ad break.
111,qczgk0_00112,I’m finding Guz very sexy in this task.
112,qczgk0_00113,Lovely darts Is there some kind of history with VCM and the Mr. Men series? It's come up more than once now
113,qczgk0_00114,Morgana Robinson sitting on a cake is probably a lot of people's fetish.
114,qczgk0_00115,Beautiful chip of the ball into the net by Alex Horne of Alex Utd.
115,qczgk0_00116,"That was actually a well thought out advert, I'm impressed"
116,qczgk0_00117,"I think I nearly wet myself watching this. Absolutely stellar episode all around. Really kind of nailed all the stuff that TM is great at. Chaos from Guz, intellectual genius and cheerful physical ineptness from VCM, Desirée's look of utter disappointment at failing so quickly when she thought she had it, Alan joining the Lovely Day Club, and Morgana's...Morgananess. Everything about this episode was delightful. Even the totally capricious live task. And so many quotable moments! All-time top 10 episode, for me."
117,qczgk0_00118,tbh that 10 ceremonial points in the last task robbed morgana of a very well deserved win.
118,qczgk0_00119,"Intrigued to learn about this ""Goo-gal"", a product or service I was not previously familiar with!"
119,qczgk0_00120,I’m disappointed it wasn’t in the washing machine.
120,qczgk0_00121,Don't like them go bang
121,qczgk0_00122,That was fucking glorious
122,qczgk0_00123,"Somewhere, Liza Tarbuck is howling with laughter"
123,qczgk0_00124,"I think the strategy in that game is only pop one a time, and hope to not hit a bad one, because you can feasibly win with only one pop."
124,qczgk0_00125,"I have been thinking about posting this for a while, but tonight’s episode confirmed it. I think the editor is in love with Morgana, they show her in the studio so much more than everyone else."
125,qczgk0_00126,"Obsessed with Desiree's ""Mwa-ha-ha-ha"" villain laugh when she found the cake"
126,qczgk0_00127,Greatest final task in the history of the show?
127,qczgk0_00128,This episode was all about Alex. I loved it.
128,qczgk0_00129,Slightly disappointed there isn't another task ad. I was hoping this would be a special episode full of them.
129,qczgk0_00130,Rhod Gilbert way is the right way in this task!
130,qczgk0_00131,I don’t have a sitting fetish at all but Morgana sitting on that cake was really erotic
131,qczgk0_00132,"This episode was great. My favorite was with Alex finding the ball Gus moved... Alex: *knocks door while peeking his little head in the window* ""Hello, Gus? Will you let me in?"" Me: Aww, how cute... Alex: *kicks down the door* Me: Ohh, SHIT! Bonus--Greg: Desiree, can you beat a moth-eaten dressing gown...that smells of FART?"
132,qczgk0_00133,Victoria's Mr Men obsession and Desiree and Morgana's studio friendship are both delightful.
133,qczgk0_00134,Are we getting an additional task through an ad. I’m so confused 😂
134,qczgk0_00135,"For the 100th ep, are we getting a revisit of the best tasks??? If a potato throw turns up imma loose my shit"
135,qczgk0_00136,Victoria's voice in the slo mo had me crying.
136,qczgk0_00137,Wonderful music for this live section!
137,qczgk0_00138,I look like a big human shrew
138,qczgk0_00139,"Okay I'm left rather confused by the goal scoring task. First of all, I initially thought the ""net must stay on its spot"" was going to be very literal, that it wasn't just about it being moved elsewhere in the yard, but all the material must stay exactly where it is presently. But it wasn't that extreme, the net was allowed to be flipped over. My first thought was to simply puncture and deflate the ball. But my main point of confusion, if Alex was allowed to directly reverse some of the things that were done to impede him from the ball (lifting Alan's tub from over it, etc), why couldn't Alex have simply turned the net itself back around right side up? like sure it seemed very clever to cut a wide whole in the netting, but ultimately that would be convoluted. This seems a very odd task if Alex was allowed to simply negate any of the forged obstacles as soon as ""his turn"" began. I also thought he really should've only been allowed a single attempt to score. I was especially thrown by what Morgana was doing. The person didn't have to stand EXACTLY 12 yards away from the ball, it was at least (cause nobody else was that precise with their position), and if she hadn't planned on doing anything else herself physically away from the ball to block it, why make sure to stand exactly there the whole time."
139,qczgk0_00140,The studio banter this series is cracking me up. I find Greg’s flirting with Morgan’s the funniest for some reason.
140,qczgk0_00141,"Wait, what? The fuck's this ad? Al Murray's back! What?"
141,qczgk0_00142,Nice to see Al again
142,qczgk0_00143,A nice task where everyone has fun. I like it 🙂
143,qczgk0_00144,"Incredible flick into the goal there, real Roy of The Rovers stuff"
144,qczgk0_00145,God I’m actually invested in darts for the first time in my life.
145,qczgk0_00146,Alex did a Hugh Dennis and just got the scissors XD!
146,qczgk0_00147,I think Morgana could have won by putting the net behind her before calling stop.
147,qczgk0_00148,What an excellent musical megamix to open up Task 1
148,qczgk0_00149,I can’t believe they ate Morgana’s arse cake.
149,qczgk0_00150,Tasks instead of ads? Oh fuck yes
150,qczgk0_00151,Al hasn’t tried bribing them yet?
151,qczgk0_00152,"Best ad break ever, wonder if they all will be?!"
152,qczgk0_00153,"""this is a big part of your life too, are you fine with that"""
153,qczgk0_00154,Guz should be playing for England
154,qczgk0_00155,5 points to Alex for that beautiful chip kick
155,qczgk0_00156,Am I the only one who thought that awarding 10 points to the winner of the live task but normal points for the rest was unfair? I think they should have done double points all round. Still loved the task though.
156,qczgk0_00157,that football task was so chaotic. it was like alex getting his revenge haha
157,qczgk0_00158,That’s a long intertitles montage.
158,qczgk0_00159,Wish Victoria would call me her little pixie.
159,qczgk0_00160,I think Victoria has the best slowed down voice I've heard
160,qczgk0_00161,I'd be so sad if I were Victoria because it looks like great fun.
161,qczgk0_00162,"That was one of the best TM episodes ever, in my view. Every task was on point"
162,qczgk0_00163,I really wish Desiree asked for a bucket of fork to pop the balloon instead during the live task! Loved the homage to past tasks!
163,qczgk0_00164,"On the football goal task, did anyone else think of stealing a page out of Rhod Gilbert's playbook and tying Alex's shoelaces together?"
164,qczgk0_00165,I wish all ad breaks were this
165,qczgk0_00166,Did they save this ad for the 100th specifically?
166,qczgk0_00167,This is the most engaging advert I've ever seen
167,qczgk0_00168,This is the music from the choreographed task in the church
168,qczgk0_00169,I bet someone will graduate from the Rhod Gilbert school of tying Alex up after the break
169,qczgk0_00170,Love Alan's face through this task. Like a child!
170,qczgk0_00171,"Man, they were really playing the epic music for that final part."
171,qczgk0_00172,A genuinely close championship (and VCM is also there)
172,qczgk0_00173,"How did no one burst the ball, that was my first thought"
173,qczgk0_00174,"Like Morgana, I was thoroughly confused by the 12 yard qualifier. I'm German (i.e. fully metric) and the penalty spot in football is known in German as the Elfmeterpunkt (lit: eleven meter spot). I always thought a yard is basically the same as a meter so I thought the hard part of the challenge was that they WEREN'T allowed to stand between the ball and the goal. I was also waiting for Greg to declare that everyone gets 0 points, since, I presume, the ball was 12 yards from the goal line... and they were all standing in front of the goal line, so less (fewer?) than 12 yards away from the ball."
174,qczgk0_00175,My immediate thought for the cake task: sit on a cake of soap. Probably much easier to find that than an actual cake!
175,qczgk0_00176,"The football task was great. I also turn my wife into a fan slowly but surely. We've watched Series 11 together and now 12. When the task got read out her first comment was ""it didn't say the spot can't be moved"". She's getting the hang on how this show works. 😅"
176,qczgk0_00177,This prize task has been hilarious
177,qczgk0_00178,"No one is going to beat Alex’s sitting on a cake, I’ll tell you that for free."
178,qczgk0_00179,"I'd go all in on the 5 bonus points - so like, oder a wedding cake, complete the task a few days late."
179,qczgk0_00180,Morgana’s face there... has awoken something in me
180,qczgk0_00181,"All of the tasks this week are going to be things that have been done to Alex but in reverse, right?"
181,qczgk0_00182,I do like it when the ad break is also the show you are watching.
182,qczgk0_00183,"Oh, this has big ""this tastes sweet"" energy."
183,qczgk0_00184,Actual adverts? Booo!
184,qczgk0_00185,I love Greg. That is all.
185,qczgk0_00186,It's a reverse Gilbert!
186,qczgk0_00187,This is like an action thriller
187,qczgk0_00188,Victoria not last again!!
188,qczgk0_00189,"ya know, it's been fairly rare when with the live task, if what they're interacting with isn't on the main stage with them, where the rules explicitly mention anything about them not being able to move off the stage. Sometimes there's a ""and you must stay on your spot"" detail, but plenty of times it says no such thing. During this episode, I'd wondered about them stepping down from the stage and trying to physically examine the balloons up close to see which maybe had different content in them, for ""the bad"" ones. Yes, production-wise it probably would've made things a bit more tedious, but it seems to me it would've been well within the bounds of the rules."
189,qczgk0_00190,"""for the 100th time, Little Alex Horne"" Hearing that really makes me want a supercut off all 100 Little Alex Horne's."
190,qczgk0_00191,Guz sure does have a lot of portraits of himself
191,qczgk0_00192,What the ACTUAL fuck have Victoria and Morgana brought in? 🤣
192,qczgk0_00193,"I have a Google pixel, I do not need this ad. But always happy for more Taskmaster content"
193,qczgk0_00194,"Oooh team task, I hope Guz has some more revelations!"
194,qczgk0_00195,"Finally clocked that Alex said ""Theres always a cake on the taskmaster premises"" (plural) edit: actually seems like premises is always plural, just the way he said it made it sound like he was pluralising it"
195,qczgk0_00196,"Oh, Alex!"
196,qczgk0_00197,Morgana is gobsmacked! Hahaha
197,qczgk0_00198,"Oh, Morgana is so competitive isn't she? She's proper raging at realising they ballsed that task up."
198,qczgk0_00199,I feel Rhod Gilbert would blindfold Alex if he was doing this task.
199,qczgk0_00200,"Desiree here, doing a perfect recreation of my PE classes"
200,qczgk0_00201,That’s genius from Alan.
201,qczgk0_00202,Fucking genius move from Guz.
202,qczgk0_00203,This is already my favourite live task ever. I do not remember many other live tasks but I’m pretty sure about this.
203,qczgk0_00204,This task has Work Xmas Do all over it.
204,qczgk0_00205,Think Guz will really enjoy Morgana’s elegant giraffe.
205,qczgk0_00206,Here's to 100 episodes Taskmaster team! That episode was a great celebration of the previous 99.
206,qczgk0_00207,Also I guess a guacamole could be elegant if you try hard enough
207,qczgk0_00208,Can someone explain why the ball task ended with disqualifications instead of ranking according to the points earned as laid out in the task?
208,qczgk0_00209,"Desiree scored ""against her team"" but technically Alex didn't score..!"
209,qczgk0_00210,Alan has absolutely just found that in his airing cupboard
210,qczgk0_00211,Can't believe I'm being that person but how did the dressing gown beat ANYTHING on that list!?
211,qczgk0_00212,What is even happening in this ad
212,qczgk0_00213,"Anyone notice the pictures of the Horne Section in the hallway next to Morgana? I know there are old TM contestants there too, but I'm sure I saw the Horne Section too!"
213,qczgk0_00214,LOL
214,qczgk0_00215,"No-one saw that coming. It looked so clever, and then it suddenly wasn't."
215,qczgk0_00216,"Well this is easy, pick up the spot and ball and run from the taskmaster house."
216,qczgk0_00217,"Little Alex ""Ronaldinho"" horne"
217,qczgk0_00218,Warmed to Desserie tonight. Love her exasperation with the tasks.
218,qczgk0_00219,"So the goal scoring task, surely you could just pop the ball? Or move it? The task said the goal and the ball had to be on their spot when time is up, maybe move the spot and put the ball somewhere else"
219,qczgk0_00220,Convinced there was a cupcake in the hidden draw in the wall
220,qczgk0_00221,I've got that music from the church copy cat dance task stuck in my head after they reused it. Is there somewhere I can find it? E.g. On the app?
221,qczgk0_00222,That giraffe is horrifying.
222,qczgk0_00223,Did Victoria get that from Wozniak’s arse?
223,qczgk0_00224,TITLE KLAXON
224,qczgk0_00225,At least Guz's legs will get a workout
225,qczgk0_00226,This ad break was Key to start
226,qczgk0_00227,Obviously tie up Alex like rhod or could they not puncture the ball?
227,qczgk0_00228,Of course she's good at Snooker.
228,qczgk0_00229,Lovely darts
229,qczgk0_00230,There's only one word for that: magic darts.
230,qczgk0_00231,"Great ep, feels good to have David Correos on the podcast for the 100th ep too. A chaotic episode for a chaotic man."
231,qczgk0_00232,I'm still coming down from the adrenaline of it but I think that live task has been my favourite live task yet. I'm probably forgetting about some bangers but this one just had it all.
232,qczgk0_00233,Nothing on youtube yet... Is it a longer episode or did I start at another time for being the 100th episode?
233,qczgk0_00234,"They're really building up the suspense for international fans by not uploading it on YouTube, that's for sure"
234,qczgk0_00235,Could someone have glued the ball to the spot?
235,qczgk0_00236,"Morgana’s tacky- sorry, elegant- giraffe is horrific and I want 20."
236,qczgk0_00237,"Hey, Guz may keep sending in portraits of himself, but it clearly works."
237,qczgk0_00238,Remember when Alex sat on his cake and got asked to be the president of a fetish group who get off on 'food fun'? Is this whole task specifically for them as an apology for saying no?
238,qczgk0_00239,"Yes, Desiree!!"
239,qczgk0_00240,"Okay, Desiree has solidified herself as my fave this season! That was amazing 👏"
240,qczgk0_00241,Alan was off his red spot...
241,qczgk0_00242,Move the spot the football is on?
242,qczgk0_00243,Lol Victoria.
243,qczgk0_00244,This is indeed darts
244,qczgk0_00245,I love seeing Alan thrive.
245,qczgk0_00246,I hope Guz doing the finger-buffing gesture makes it into a lot of clips videos.
246,qczgk0_00247,"OK, so I can't remember what specific word Morgana was yelling at Alex when he was cutting through the net during the football task---infuriating? unfathomable?--but when she was yelling it, she sounded EXACTLY like her Natalie Cassidy impression, and it was amazing."
247,qczgk0_00248,There was definitely an Arsenal joke Alan could have made during that football task
248,qczgk0_00249,I am looking forward to another hour of utter carnage/shithousery
249,qczgk0_00250,"Wow, Greg actually called Alex the unsung hero of the series. This really is a special episode."
250,qczgk0_00251,Victoria makes Mr Greedy.
251,qczgk0_00252,Just noticed that the Taskmaster house kitchen has the same cupboards as I do - and I’ve spent the last 18 months wanting rid of them.
252,qczgk0_00253,I’m worried about these contestants who are sitting on candles that have just been put out.
253,qczgk0_00254,-1
254,qczgk0_00255,I’d love some ‘you and me 😉’ time with Greg.
255,qczgk0_00256,Big brain play by Guz
256,qczgk0_00257,"Hol up, did Guz just refer to Alex as ‘the taskmaster’?"
257,qczgk0_00258,The banter in this show was great. Especially during the studio segments and the final task. I was laughing at everyone's quick little quips and rewinding to hear them again.
258,qczgk0_00259,Alex finally getting his revenge.
259,qczgk0_00260,Did she ... blend her cake mix?
260,qczgk0_00261,This looks like the new years set
261,qczgk0_00262,Oh god this task would have taken an age to set up.
262,qczgk0_00263,Great episode and what a live task!
263,qczgk0_00264,One of my favourite eps of this series but also maybe across all!
264,qczgk0_00265,Happy hundred!
265,qczgk0_00266,Of course its in a teapot
266,qczgk0_00267,Squat cobbler!
267,qczgk0_00268,
268,qczgk0_00269,"I like how Alan's ""what a ridiculous question"" strategy seems to be just as effective as Victoria's master bullshitting."
269,qczgk0_00270,The cake was in the washing machine!
270,qczgk0_00271,I have a horrible feeling Alan and Victoria made the exact same mistake
271,qczgk0_00272,Nothing!?!? 😮😮😮 Remind me how many other 0 point tasks there have been? That was all excellent.
272,qczgk0_00273,Guz you genius!
273,qczgk0_00274,THE T E N S I O N
274,qczgk0_00275,Sid Waddell would be proud
275,qczgk0_00276,"I’m sorry, has this episode been published already? Can’t find it on YouTube"
276,qczgk0_00277,Why was Alex's whistle broken in the ball task? I feel we've all missed something here.
277,qczgk0_00278,Morgana's prize tasks are consistently bad. I love it
278,qczgk0_00279,What's that brass cock looking thing on the wall of the kitchen?
279,qczgk0_00280,I want a secret cake room!
280,qczgk0_00281,It was a google translate ad! Ha!
281,qczgk0_00282,Desiree made sitting on a shaving foam cake look cool.
282,qczgk0_00283,Could you move the box?
283,qczgk0_00284,Kinder Milk Slice looks horrendously processed
284,qczgk0_00285,-128##
285,qczgk0_00286,Desiree helped the ball in.
286,qczgk0_00287,"If that was real football, you could actually get me to watch it!"
287,qczgk0_00288,This is top quality.
288,qczgk0_00289,This is so tense
289,qczgk0_00290,The iceman has fallen.
290,qczgk0_00291,A flapjack is not a cake.
291,qczgk0_00292,Why did they get -1 and not -100?
292,qczgk0_00293,"Am I going crazy or did Alan blow out the candles and then sit on his ""cake"" to the Super Mario theme?"
293,qczgk0_00294,The music
294,qczgk0_00295,Why isn't it on Youtube yet? They uploaded some task with Desiree and Al Murray instead. Which is weird because they never post videos of individual tasks for episodes that aren't out yet.
295,qczgk0_00296,I can’t get one thing off my head: why did Alex’s whistle malfunction in the Balls in the net task for both of the teams. Because it seemed like he was faking it. Was he doing just for a bit? Or was there a replacement whistle in a bigger net in his pocket if anyone asked for it? Maybe it was just for the bit.
296,qczgk0_00297,Does anyone know what the music during the final task is?
297,qczgk0_00298,Can someone link the ad everyone's talking about? I didn't get it on catch up
298,qczgk0_00299,Is it 100 including or excluding CoC / NYE
299,qczgk0_00300,Happy hundred taskmaster!
300,qczgk0_00301,I can’t believe Greg praised Alex twice in one series. Can’t have Alex getting cocky.
301,qczgk0_00302,Greg hating on flowers
302,qczgk0_00303,Cake time
303,qczgk0_00304,"Is this episode, in celebration of #100, going to have tasks reminiscent of some of the best moments of taskmaster perhaps? Interesting that they saved the cake episode til this one and has got me thinking!"
304,qczgk0_00305,I feel like Alan and Victoria are losing this
305,qczgk0_00306,I could swear it said handled not struck?
306,qczgk0_00307,I'm envisaging a big minus score here
307,qczgk0_00308,They could move the goal? I thought the task said they couldn't
308,qczgk0_00309,RIP Alan.
309,qczgk0_00310,Shouldn't Guz have got 5 for most balloons plus another 10?
310,qczgk0_00311,"The football task reminded me how good taskmaster can be, sadly this series hasn't been great."
311,qczgk0_00312,Anyone have a good place to watch s12 in the US. The google drive and youtube have both failed me.
312,qczgk0_00313,Morgana is going to find a way to make sitting on a cake sexy somehow
313,qczgk0_00314,Happy hundredth.
314,qczgk0_00315,Hey guys what was the category for the prize task? I saw the actual prizes but I only got that it was something to do with elegance
315,qczgk0_00316,"Wait, that was the whole task? What?"
316,qczgk0_00317,Desiree with the skills!
317,qczgk0_00318,
318,qczgk0_00319,Very good episode. Not been a huge fan of thelis series so far but this was golden.
319,qczgk0_00320,
320,qczgk0_00321,Alan should have brought in Gilberto Silva
321,qczgk0_00322,
322,qczgk0_00323,Alan disqualified surely?
0,qd2rkz_00001,That right there is the best studio task in the history of Taskmaster.
1,qd2rkz_00002,Guz channeling Rhod on the goal preventing task
2,qd2rkz_00003,YouTube episodes blocked in these countries: United Kingdom Finland Norway New Zealand Canada (S12+) Sweden Denmark United States (S8+) Australia
0,qhumps_00001,I can't believe how many people here think Victoria was being genuine about the gift task. It's so obviously a troll gift. Alan even called it calculated passive aggressive.
1,qhumps_00002,"Victoria blatantly is legally blind and is covering it up very well apart from when it comes to seeing big red chairs and when the “writing is on the wall” (secret tower), well done girl, up until now you’ve done a grand job."
2,qhumps_00003,"I'm not just saying this because I've fallen undyingly in love with Victoria and will now defend to death every single thing she says or does on the show, but it definitely isn't unreasonable to think that they would have put a (small toy) chair into that sweet as part of the task. It would've been pretty on brand....after all they did pull some next level shit when they put that key into a candle"
3,qhumps_00004,"What if Victoria got a Spurs season pass for Alan, not sure which is worse TBH..."
4,qhumps_00005,"Really loved this episode. This season has been a real return to form I feel in that so many of the tasks are just simple and elegant. You still have rules overload tasks, but also just like “toss this iron on that board”. Also one of the best prize tasks maybe ever. Everyone is mostly so jazzed about their gift (even Alan, getting a kick out of it) and it’s just nice to see. The live task was also a wonderful disaster, though I do wish it was more “functional”. My first thought was for some reason that I would take 0 papers before finding out what it was, and it turns out that would have worked quite well. It was also very fun to see Alex suddenly realize how scuffed it all was when Alan started with like -40 points"
5,qhumps_00006,Greg had a real Mugatu moment with Alex before that break.
6,qhumps_00007,"I thought the darts were riveting, but this ah! I was so invested."
7,qhumps_00008,Loved the googly eyes on the shredder - nice nod to one of Noel Fielding's tasks I believe?
8,qhumps_00009,"Omg the live task was hilarious, I haven't laughed that much in a while"
9,qhumps_00010,Best prize round ever? Been ages since we've had a proper prize round.
10,qhumps_00011,"The red chair was Victoria's ""Am I the spider?"" moment"
11,qhumps_00012,“All the information is on the task” must be THE most infuriating thing to hear that little shit say.
12,qhumps_00013,STOP BEING NICE
13,qhumps_00014,I absolutely knew Victoria wouldn’t let us down.
14,qhumps_00015,I cannot help but feel that Victoria would be doing a LOT better if she had remembered her glasses and could see more than 8 feet in front of her.
15,qhumps_00016,
16,qhumps_00017,'We have defeated the format of this show' 😂😂😂😂
17,qhumps_00018,He got his painting!! EDIT - AND HE GAVE EVERYONE THE PRIZES THEY WANTED THIS IS WHOLESOMENESS
18,qhumps_00019,"Guz showing Victoria how to make paper airplanes!! Gosh, I couldn’t love this cast any more if I tried."
19,qhumps_00020,"Alans' FACE at the Man U ticket, I want it preserved for all eternity in a picture to be hung in the National Gallery"
20,qhumps_00021,"Brother, please can we get Marco flairs"
21,qhumps_00022,"""This task has really backfired"" Greg looked appalled and distressed by the genuinely thoughtful and sweet prizes."
22,qhumps_00023,"That was the best overall Prize Task in a very very long time, absolutely amazing. From the wholesomeness from Alan, Desiree, Guz, and Morgana to the absolute brutal destruction that was Victoria's prize."
23,qhumps_00024,Can't get over the way Morgana jumped off those circles
24,qhumps_00025,"""I've just eaten two creme eggs and I'm not really up for this"" is straight into the book of relatable Taskmaster quotes for me"
25,qhumps_00026,"As a United fan I wouldn’t wish that on Alan, Victoria clearly hasn’t watched us in years."
26,qhumps_00027,Victoria: (redefines “red chair” to include a red dot and sits on it) Greg: (allows her redefinition of ‘chair’) Victoria: “Charitable.” She’s great.
27,qhumps_00028,Bollocks. Bollocks. Bollocks. so close not bollocks
28,qhumps_00029,I was so sure there would be a penalty for eating the sweet
29,qhumps_00030,"My god Victoria's prize for Alan was so good. I don't know if everyone here is a football fan, but that is genuinely one of the worst things possible for him hahahha. For some perspective I'm a Man United fan and when I was a little kid someone bought me an Arsenal shirt as a gift and I threw it on the ground in front of them. My Dad scolded me for not appreciating the gift, but once the guy left he was like ""well done son."" It is a proper rivalry hahaha."
30,qhumps_00031,is victoria the spider?
31,qhumps_00032,I've only known Marco for five minutes but if anything were to happen to him I would kill everyone in this thread and then myself
32,qhumps_00033,I can’t believe Guz is winning this series. I’m shocked and also pleased for him.
33,qhumps_00034,Alan's throwing action is excellent. Absolutely textbook iron hurling
34,qhumps_00035,Victoria freaking out about there being a dog is just about the cutest thing I've ever seen
35,qhumps_00036,All these minus points will be reminding Alan of QI
36,qhumps_00037,"Guz giving the prizes out!!! Oh, Lord, the friendships!!"
37,qhumps_00038,Marco should be in all episodes.
38,qhumps_00039,I'm not surprised none of them got any in. Paper airplanes have terrible flight controls.
39,qhumps_00040,Alan and Victoria as a sitcom husband and wife.
40,qhumps_00041,Guz’s face when he thinks Desirée got him a dog night be my new favorite taskmaster moment of all time.
41,qhumps_00042,"Victoria's ""chair in a sweet"" moment is on the level of ""am I the spider?"" in terms of people whose brains were broken by a task."
42,qhumps_00043,We have defeated the format of your show!
43,qhumps_00044,"The prize task was one of the best ever. Guz's little face at seeing the painting! I sound like a broken record at this point, but I wish they would stop with the overly complicated tasks. This one was a bit more bearable thanks to Victoria's slight breakdown, but the contestants are so focused on the rules that it's hard for them to be naturally funny. The 'amuse a dog' task proves that the simpler, the better."
44,qhumps_00045,Is that the bathroom set Mark Watson brought in that time?
45,qhumps_00046,“All the information is on the task” must be THE most infuriating thing to hear that little shit say. Correction: It’s probably more infuriating after you’ve shredded the task.
46,qhumps_00047,"You need to put some sausages in a driving glove, that'll do the trick"
47,qhumps_00048,I really wanted to see Victoria meet Marco.
48,qhumps_00049,"Victoria: ""Am I the Spider Chair?"""
49,qhumps_00050,I thought Greg would give Victoria 5 just for the horrible gift.
50,qhumps_00051,"The prize task was possibly the most wholesome thing in Taskmaster history, I adored it. Then along came Marco and made the whole episode even better."
51,qhumps_00052,"Victoria's ""do I have to make a chair"" strongly reminds of ""am I the spider"""
52,qhumps_00053,I'm suspicious of the sweet. I'm starting to think that they'll be disqualified for eating it
53,qhumps_00054,Morgana is equal parts genius and chaos That laugh she was doing was scary
54,qhumps_00055,"""It's just your tooth"" is one of the most brutal things ever said on Taskmaster"
55,qhumps_00056,“A chair in a sweet” is giving me “am I the spider” vibes
56,qhumps_00057,"I haven’t finished the episode (barely started), I just want to say that the Victoria season ticket debacle was one of the most amusing prize tasks, especially with the juxtaposition of everyone else loving their gifts. I feel like there also was a gradually diminishing return of enthusiasm after Desiree’s present for Guz, culminating in the Man U season tickets."
57,qhumps_00058,"Aw, Guz giving the gifts out to the others. Except to Alan, because Victoria's choice was terrible. Sorry Victoria, but it was."
58,qhumps_00059,"Something in my mind tells me that Victoria knew exactly what she was doing when she brought the Man Utd season ticket in, and that for me makes the whole thing even better."
59,qhumps_00060,"STOP BEING NICE! We have defeated the format of your show. Don't mind me, just cackling away here I might've done exactly what VCM did, if the person I was buying for was a good friend. If I had enough money I'm willing to part with I'd intentionally get a Man U fan friend a Liverpool season ticket because after that latest game they might want to watch a real team instead. I wonder if she'd have gotten more points if she'd said she'd intended the insult? Edit: After thinking about it, I am now pretty sure that VCM was, indeed, trolling Alan. Man, Guz is absolutely hilarious. And a couple good ideas in the iron task - Alan using a backboard, and Guz widening the landing area Victoria is just either baffled or baffling, and I'm loving it. A cat cutout for the dog? What even? Red chair task was pretty convoluted. I wonder if putting it physically in the shredder but not through the shredder would count? Also, oh man, I feel so bad for Victoria. I'm pretty myopic too (over 5 dioptres), and without my glasses I would never have seen that chair from Victoria's starting location. In fact, I probably wouldn't even have been able to realize that the sign saying ""Secret Tower"" even existed, and the red arrow would've just been a blob. Did love the Katherine Parkinson vibes, though KP's breakdown was far more entertaining Victoria: ""That's chairitable."" Heh. MORGANA! Can't believe she was the only one to try shuffling! And on that live task... was won based on the number of papers they selected lmao Another bottom placement from Victoria xD She's currently on track to take the title of most bottom placements... up there with all-time greats like Nish (6/8, 75%), Roisin (4/6, 67%) and Charlotte (6/10, 60%)"
60,qhumps_00061,I am baffled at how many people are confused by Victoria's obvious obvious joke gift of a Manchester United voucher. It's so clearly a joke.
61,qhumps_00062,I love that he's doing this exactly the same way as when he brought his daughter in....
62,qhumps_00063,"The funny thing about the Secret Tower task is that it wasn’t even THAT complicated, particularly as the contestants clearly had enough circles to comfortably circuit the entire space without having to reuse them. Nobody ran out of circles at any point and apart from that it was just remembering to grab the chair—poor Victoria! I feel like having to shred the task was a mind trick to make the task SEEM harder. Compared to, say, the airport luggage task from last series, this was a cakewalk."
63,qhumps_00064,
64,qhumps_00065,"""Where ist the chair?"" has the same energy as ""Am I the spider?"""
65,qhumps_00066,"“I’ve just eaten two Creme Eggs and I’m not really up for this.” God, Alan is so relatable."
66,qhumps_00067,MOTHERFATHER!
67,qhumps_00068,"The prize task was rather sweet in that one contestant had a gift for another and reacting happily (to the chagrin of Greg). But Victoria had the reliability that Greg expected by essentially putting Alan in the lions den with a football team he dislikes, with a season pass that isn't fully paid off! And Gus giving the gifts back to the others--haven't seen that before in the show's history! Good show all around. Bonus...Victoria: They're in the balloon? This is a sweet--I mean, there can't be a chair in the sweet, can there? Am I supposed to make a chair? I mean...d-do I have to...make it be in here?"
68,qhumps_00069,"""Pipey had a hat!"""
69,qhumps_00070,"""... My eyes are circles..."""
70,qhumps_00071,"""What on earth are you talking about?"" 😂😂"
71,qhumps_00072,Okay. But why are Desiree and Morgana so fashionable?? It's unfair.
72,qhumps_00073,"For the circles task, I would've just ignored the circles and rolled to the tower, Rob Beckett style"
73,qhumps_00074,Fell in love with Victoria so much when she did the ‘whyyyyy’ at not getting to meet the dog.
74,qhumps_00075,"""STOP BEING NICE"" I love this cast's friendliness so much"
75,qhumps_00076,That's the laugh of someone who's done enough taskmaster.
76,qhumps_00077,Morgana snatching defeat from the jaws of victory on the chair task was the perfect energy we’ve come to expect
77,qhumps_00078,"Exactly what I was thinking, Morgana. Edit: oh fuck she completely fucked this up"
78,qhumps_00079,
79,qhumps_00080,I thought for sure there was going to be some kind of hidden penalty for eating the sweet.
80,qhumps_00081,"I can see this is where the cast comes together like a bunch of Care Bears against the evil Taskmaster (according to Guz Khan), haha. In fairness, that was a nice prize task with some ingenuity shown with the iron task, as well. I really hope VCM wins one episode before the series ends..."
81,qhumps_00082,"Most wholesome series since S4, if not ever"
82,qhumps_00083,"The last task was really about picking the fewest sheets of paper, then you win. Given that there were 25 sheets available, picking 8 or so didn’t sound unreasonable to me. I was thinking that 2 was far too low. You are leaving 92% behind. Alex seemed shocked or bemused the contestants starting with -40, but if so then why have so many sheets? Given the penalty per sheet and the difficulty of making paper airplanes go anywhere, the award for hitting the tub should have been 50 or more. Frankly that should have been the only target. It was also unfair that the people who were penalised with a points deduction were penalised with a time penalty as well, having the same time to make planes as the others. Should have been 30 seconds per sheet. Yes that task unduly annoyed me in what was otherwise a fairly perfect episode."
83,qhumps_00084,"Only Morgana we'll ever have, King Arthur's sister will never do Taskmaster."
84,qhumps_00085,The biggest anticlimax in Taskmaster history? Maybe.
85,qhumps_00086,
86,qhumps_00087,"Everyone else buys sweet, thoughtful gifts and Victoria totally game plays. I love her. 🤣"
87,qhumps_00088,Morgana did what I would have done with the circles. Then she just....jumped off then because she forgot part 2. That little ta-da! pose was adorable though.
88,qhumps_00089,Best tactic here is definitely 0 sheets
89,qhumps_00090,The conviction VCM has when she said the word “Cat” was holding her dog toy was everything.
90,qhumps_00091,Guz: “We’ve defeated the format of this show.”
91,qhumps_00092,The wholesomeness is new. I still remember Joe’s potato throw and how the others hilariously threw him under the bus.
92,qhumps_00093,I was so sure taking the sweet in the red chair task was going to lose people points.
93,qhumps_00094,These targets should have scored so much higher...
94,qhumps_00095,If anyone can find Morgana's jacket from this episode I would appreciate it. The woman is a goddess with IMPECCABLE taste.
95,qhumps_00096,"Oh, my God, can these contestants always be on the show. They’re giving me the same wholesome friendship vibes of the TMNZ series 2 cast."
96,qhumps_00097,I demand Marco becomes a recurring part of the show in future. Also feeling more and more sorry for Victoria's childhood as the series goes on - she never learned how to ride a bike & doesn't know how to make paper airplanes :(
97,qhumps_00098,Look at Guz’s happy face looking at his dream dog 😭
98,qhumps_00099,Victoria must have done that intentionally right? Because that's absolutely hysterical.
99,qhumps_00100,A++++ prize task
100,qhumps_00101,Great to see Catherine Parkinson again
101,qhumps_00102,Victoria wants to meet the dog.
102,qhumps_00103,whyyyyyyyyyy
103,qhumps_00104,This is an all time great cast. I love that you can see that all of them have a genuine affection for each other. Taskmaster NZ wholesome lovefest creeping its way into the OG. I want all of them to win.
104,qhumps_00105,
105,qhumps_00106,"Really feeling the chemistry between the contestants this episode, really ge the sense they are loving the experience."
106,qhumps_00107,Stop being nice!
107,qhumps_00108,This is amazing. Even Victoria's is hilarious
108,qhumps_00109,I love Marco 😭
109,qhumps_00110,They're all helping each other ♥️ this cast ♥️
110,qhumps_00111,That was a real good doggo. I hope they do a kitty task next series (no trees involved).
111,qhumps_00112,"What a weird prize task, as only one contestant was going to receive the gift actually intended for them!"
112,qhumps_00113,Taaaaskmaster's oooooon. Iiiiiit is on nooooooow.
113,qhumps_00114,Powerful homoeroticism. I really enjoyed it.
114,qhumps_00115,Good task in theory - shite execution
115,qhumps_00116,"Did Alex pick up that ""I love you"" from Joe Lycett?"
116,qhumps_00117,Everyone else gets a personalised gift. Alan popped into Foyle's on the way to filming.
117,qhumps_00118,Circles? Acaster is activated!
118,qhumps_00119,Morgana getting a big brain idea and then implementing it badly. Same.
119,qhumps_00120,"Best solution here would be to only take a couple of sheets, but rip them in half or quarters and make multiple planes from each sheet. Edit: and also learn how to make paper planes properly"
120,qhumps_00121,"Guz Khan referencing 1990s Premier League Goalkeepers during an episode of Taskmaster scratched a very specific itch for me, very niche and enjoyable"
121,qhumps_00122,Alan Davis had an amazing energy in this episode
122,qhumps_00123,"Oh Alex. I've been there, mate..."
123,qhumps_00124,THIS IS FOR NEVILLE SOUTHALL
124,qhumps_00125,Not to be dramatic but I would die for Marco
125,qhumps_00126,Is it really a secret tower if there’s a “secret tower” sign and arrow pointing to it?
126,qhumps_00127,"That was the best prize task in a long time, perhaps ever."
127,qhumps_00128,In my opinion for the sweet chair task; There shouldn't be an extra task. It defeats the purpose of risking to shred it immediately upon doing it. It was just kinda eh.
128,qhumps_00129,I love the contrast in studio outfits between Guz and Victoria. He’s going on a polar expedition and she’s going to a garden party.
129,qhumps_00130,Victoria is amazing lmao
130,qhumps_00131,Shaka Hislop is a deep cut
131,qhumps_00132,"Tell you what, this series has given some of the most wholesome contestants, including one of my new favourites: Mr Guz Khan 👌 Hilarious bloke. Each of the contestants bring their own quirkiness, and I love that, Alan with his whole competitive uncle persona who doesn’t mind if he wins or loses, Desiree brings her American charm by being the OTT one, Guz is cool and chill but secretly hides a slight craziness 😅, Morgana is the very competitive one who finds a way around tasks and is oddly attractive 🤔 & Victoria ALWAYS questions the tasks to make sure 100% that she’s doing it correctly. Was gonna say the best lineup in a while, but I forgot how perfect most of them are"
132,qhumps_00133,"It's been nagging at me ever since I saw Morgana for the first time a few weeks before this series debuted who she reminded me of (this happens somewhat often for me with people, especially with it being very subtle things that trigger a memory in me), and I think it might've finally clicked in for me during this episode. I feel like she's got a rather strong Betti Davis quality in her eyes. just curious, anyone else get me on this?"
133,qhumps_00134,"YAAAAY, the subtitles are back! Fully accessible Taskmaster, the best kind of Taskmaster!"
134,qhumps_00135,The friendships this series are so wholesome!
135,qhumps_00136,Yes VCM
136,qhumps_00137,Immediately I'm thinking just tie a string to somewhere high and make a makeshift zipline for the iron
137,qhumps_00138,Awww his little tail wagging 🥰
138,qhumps_00139,Please...what kind of dog was Marco?
139,qhumps_00140,I rewatched this last night when I couldn't sleep and there is a moment during one of Alan's slowed-down throws where you can hear him laughing in the studio and it's glorious.
140,qhumps_00141,I do enjoy watching Alan Davies in this. He's so relatable
141,qhumps_00142,Victoria is last again. She deserves better!
142,qhumps_00143,"I was already dreading Victoria's prize when she said ""Manchester"" because I remembered her Premier League bits on HIGNFY and The Last Leg"
143,qhumps_00144,The only thing that would have been better for VCM's gift was if it was Spurs season tickets.
144,qhumps_00145,"Tick tock, it's Taskmaster o'clock"
145,qhumps_00146,"This is peak Greg, he is absolutely on fire"
146,qhumps_00147,Victoria has used not having her glasses as an excuse every single episode so far...starting to think she forgot them on purpose so she could have an excuse!
147,qhumps_00148,Is there going to be something about the sweet and balloons on the back of the task?
148,qhumps_00149,"""I've just eaten two Creme Eggs and I'm not really up for this"" is my whole mood in March and April"
149,qhumps_00150,"I mean i love this cast, i already know i'm going to love this series more than even the last one with wozniak."
150,qhumps_00151,"I just couldn't wait until I got home and it's a really slow night at work, so I just finished the episode and my jaw literally hurts from attempting to laugh silently. (I'm in an office right next to my boss lol.) When Victoria missed that last ""architectural"" plane, that was it for me, I can't. I imagine that was so demoralizing without a studio audience, but as the viewer it had me in stitches."
151,qhumps_00152,Guz looks the happiest I've ever seen him
152,qhumps_00153,This has backfired gloriously on Greg
153,qhumps_00154,"Oop, here comes VCM. Love it."
154,qhumps_00155,How has he not given her the five points though after all that
155,qhumps_00156,Cat.
156,qhumps_00157,Marco is the cutest
157,qhumps_00158,I know all too well from the Man Down outtakes how much Greg loves doing a wretch lol.
158,qhumps_00159,Motherfather
159,qhumps_00160,There's a catch with the sweet. There has to be.
160,qhumps_00161,What was the story with the balloons and the sweet in the secret room??
161,qhumps_00162,Ahahahah what a horrible livetask.
162,qhumps_00163,What kind of terrier is Marco?
163,qhumps_00164,This iron-throwing task seems like the sort of task that would have the Health and Safety advisor on the set whimpering in terror.
164,qhumps_00165,Wish Morgana and Victoria would adopt me.
165,qhumps_00166,This is going to be like the 'engage a toddler' task and that was one of my favourite tasks of all time so I'm going to love this!
166,qhumps_00167,So is the answer to just not take your feet off the circles and skate around like a waterboatman?
167,qhumps_00168,"Morgana Robinson, the somehow failing Bosh Queen."
168,qhumps_00169,Morgana's very stylish
169,qhumps_00170,Basket on ironing board = valid So ironing board upside down = earth on the ironing board. Throw iron onto earth from far away = win
170,qhumps_00171,"For the ironing board task, the Hugh Dennis method would have been walking as far away with Alex and then having Alex walk the iron back."
171,qhumps_00172,Anyone know what breed Marco is?
172,qhumps_00173,I love how much this group loves each other
173,qhumps_00174,Haha this is exactly the same task as the engage the toddler task.
174,qhumps_00175,Careers VCM 📉 Morgana 📈
175,qhumps_00176,Guz's face when he offered the boy dog a lady dog was something else ha
176,qhumps_00177,I would die for Marco
177,qhumps_00178,Dogs love cardboard tubes. Is this not well-known?
178,qhumps_00179,Could they slide with the circles instead?
179,qhumps_00180,"oh, Victoria. The chair isn't in the balloon you crazy goose"
180,qhumps_00181,"Yep, this cast is my favourite. Perfect mix of chaos and lunacy"
181,qhumps_00182,If it’s not dart balloon pop 2 I’m not interested.
182,qhumps_00183,"Shaka Hislop! Haven’t heard that name in years, the last person I expected to get a shout out!"
183,qhumps_00184,"would've been more advantageous to sit this one out altogether, lol"
184,qhumps_00185,Oh my god I want Marco
185,qhumps_00186,Where can I order a Pipey and Priscilla for my pup??
186,qhumps_00187,Some real Charlotte Ritchie energy from Morgana with her giggling there!
187,qhumps_00188,That task had big Taskmaster NZ toilet roll tower task energy.
188,qhumps_00189,I love Guz
189,qhumps_00190,"I have a (dare I say close to Rhod Gilbert-esque?) idea for how to do the iron board task, and I wonder if it would've been allowed. First of all I would've laid down the ironing board on its side on the ground, but with it still fully 'stretched out', its stand mechanism fully elongated. Then wrap up the iron with as much material as necessary so as to create as close to a sphere around it that I could. Tie a very long rope around it, then roll that on the ground from the furthest possible distance until the ""iron"" comes up to and hits the surface of the ironing board."
190,qhumps_00191,For the circles task - could you walk to the shredder using red circles only. Then to the chair and back to the shredder with black (as could step on them twice) with the rest of the red to the secret tower?
191,qhumps_00192,this cast is approaching series 9 levels of friendship
192,qhumps_00193,Best prize task ever! Absolutely brilliant
193,qhumps_00194,I want Alan's Simpsons hoodie so bad
194,qhumps_00195,My idea is to shuffle on one pair of discs - you've only stood on them once as long as you keep your feet planted.
195,qhumps_00196,It's giving… it's giving Chair.
196,qhumps_00197,Taskmaster can't get any better!...a dog!!!!! Marco! I love him more of him!
197,qhumps_00198,This is amazing. Two great studio tasks on the bash.
198,qhumps_00199,loving the Morgana giggle. I'm surprised no one else slid them.
199,qhumps_00200,"Victoria channeling the ""You sit on it but you don't take it with you"" riddle from Goldeneye"
200,qhumps_00201,"Alan started doing the shuffle with his circles at one point, not sure why he didn’t continue"
201,qhumps_00202,Here's to some Guz shithousery
202,qhumps_00203,Priscilla is to Marco as Thresher sharks are to Alex's daughter
203,qhumps_00204,'I've had to 2 creme eggs' - Alan Davis is an every man
204,qhumps_00205,Alan had two Creme Eggs before every task? Genius. I will be using this productivity system throughout university.
205,qhumps_00206,Morgana is chaos.
206,qhumps_00207,Morgana is a choatic genius
207,qhumps_00208,Aw Guz got his picture and gets to keep his coat!
208,qhumps_00209,Why doesn't Victoria wear her glasses?
209,qhumps_00210,do NOT bow
210,qhumps_00211,this is so wholesome ♥️ I love this cast
211,qhumps_00212,Poor Chonky
212,qhumps_00213,Marco has no interest in Alex Horne.
213,qhumps_00214,"Eyes are circles, right?"
214,qhumps_00215,"Turns out when you go black, you can go back (but just once)"
215,qhumps_00216,"Oh Victoria.... Honestly we should expect it but still, lol"
216,qhumps_00217,"Oh Channel 4 you sneaky bastards, now I'm watching the adverts so I don't miss any potential Murray/Burch time. THE TARGETED ADS ARE WORKING GODDAMNIT!"
217,qhumps_00218,No catch with the sweet???
218,qhumps_00219,I'd get a drone. Did it say throw or just land?
219,qhumps_00220,Widows is terrific film. Get involved.
220,qhumps_00221,Can you stand really far away and ask Alex to take it to the board for you?
221,qhumps_00222,"And Alan Davies takes home the gold! Wait, sorry, this isn't the Olympics."
222,qhumps_00223,"Even though Alan managed to smash the iron, he won."
223,qhumps_00224,This is gonna be a good episode for some Taskmaster without context quotes
224,qhumps_00225,"Are you sure Gus? For dogs, the last 18 months has been the greatest ever."
225,qhumps_00226,I already love this dog so much it hurts
226,qhumps_00227,TV's Al Murray! What are you doing here?
227,qhumps_00228,Swear to god I thought it was getting humped
228,qhumps_00229,Guz has to win that with not using food
229,qhumps_00230,Think my dog may have fallen in love with Marco
230,qhumps_00231,All the information is on the card 😂
231,qhumps_00232,That was the worst excuse for fish and chips I've ever seen.
232,qhumps_00233,Was that the National Lotto advertising tentacle porn??
233,qhumps_00234,"Morgana came so close, but forgot to read the task."
234,qhumps_00235,"There's room for semantic pedantry here. What if ""you may only walk on circles"" means ""you may not slide on circles"". Were it up to me, this studio discussion would be long and boring"
235,qhumps_00236,Well Alan’s fucked
236,qhumps_00237,I'm so glad I chose one sheet of paper
237,qhumps_00238,"Oooh, I love the idea of this prize category."
238,qhumps_00239,Fuck that's good
239,qhumps_00240,This is far too wholesome lol.
240,qhumps_00241,I feel like VCM has hacked this task.
241,qhumps_00242,GOOD BOI
242,qhumps_00243,Aw what a cutie
243,qhumps_00244,"This is another overly complicated task, I’ve already forgotten all the rules."
244,qhumps_00245,"Did it say ""shred the task"", or ""put the task in the shredder"". Because maybe you could just put it directly in the bin"
245,qhumps_00246,Last ad break already. This show always goes by far too fast!
246,qhumps_00247,I don't want to cook my dinner in a printer
247,qhumps_00248,Morgana is a fucking genius.
248,qhumps_00249,I hope whoever wins lets Guz have his dog picture.
249,qhumps_00250,"To be fair Alan it's not like United are any good this year, could be fun to go watch them and laugh"
250,qhumps_00251,6.4 Shaka Hislops‽ Legend
251,qhumps_00252,Oh you never say how hard could this be
252,qhumps_00253,DOGGO
253,qhumps_00254,I thought Marco walked out on Victoria's then.
254,qhumps_00255,I love how Guz is lounging in his chair
255,qhumps_00256,"Yes, another Taskmaster ad!"
256,qhumps_00257,"On the verge of tears, we're reaching dangerous levels of cuteness."
257,qhumps_00258,RIP Priscilla.
258,qhumps_00259,Fucking hell
259,qhumps_00260,The funniest episode of TM. EVer
260,qhumps_00261,60 minutes of Morgana time
261,qhumps_00262,"Whirls iron around ""You can really get some distance!"" Clips I remember from the trailers."
262,qhumps_00263,"Looks like the boys and Desree chose to throw the iron, the other two girls are using elaborate machines."
263,qhumps_00264,Honestly this is already a contender for one of my fave episodes.
264,qhumps_00265,Marko is so cute!!
265,qhumps_00266,Haha just stick food in it
266,qhumps_00267,"""We've got Raheem Sterling to play Man"""
267,qhumps_00268,Grace Jones?
268,qhumps_00269,Priscilla is making me wheeze.
269,qhumps_00270,That dog advert is genuinely the most insulting thing I've ever seen
270,qhumps_00271,0 sheets please
271,qhumps_00272,"Guz should have lost the Spot Task for not stepping on a spot when entering the Secret Tower, right?"
272,qhumps_00273,Why did someone not ask for some tape and tape a circle to each shoe and just walk there? I’d argue that you only stepped on the spots once to tape them to your shoes!
273,qhumps_00274,"For the iron task, you could tie a long string round the handle, sit it on a table 6 inches above the ironing board, stand on the other side of the garden and pull the string/rope. You're only limited by the length of the rope."
274,qhumps_00275,Raheem Sterling is not an actor.
275,qhumps_00276,So Guz is secretly a dog toy expert.
276,qhumps_00277,"So, Victoria has never seen a folding chair..."
277,qhumps_00278,While the adverts are on - does anyone know what kind of dog Marco is?
278,qhumps_00279,Turns out contestants are always seated in alphabetical order https://twitter.com/elocemearg/status/1453831053454594059?t=gZCU2uZrdGxUrZPsfpEpdQ&s=19
279,qhumps_00280,"Guess you could put something like a blanket on the ironing board, place the iron on top, then whip the blanket away?"
280,qhumps_00281,Is it my imagination or did this hostility towards the adverts from Greg only start when they moved to channel 4? I wonder if that's something they've wanted to do for years but Dave wouldn't let them.
281,qhumps_00282,Any money the title is said by Morgana
282,qhumps_00283,
283,qhumps_00284,Fill the toy with treats.

0,qmttuh_00001,"I've got a funny feeling that I'll be in the (even very tiny?) minority with this opinion, but I'm really starting to miss the live audience. Obviously the change had to occur, and brought with it a new dynamic that I certainly enjoyed for what it was. There were some elements I liked about it and were nice to see. And not like I'm advocating for it to be switched if they're not ready, public health's most important, but I feel like there's been a certain demeanor shift in Greg himself. He's not quite as consistently ""alive"", if that makes any sense. One of the dynamics I always really liked was how well he played off the crowd sometimes. Leaning into how he didn't ""care"" if they had a bad reaction to something, etc. all in all I really do like this group, and it's gone by WAY faster than I expected. I was just saying to someone else the other day, while 2020 took like three goddamn decades to play out, oddly in some way it's felt to me like 2021's barely been six months total."
1,qmttuh_00002,"He's not just a PA, he's a PAIN!"
2,qmttuh_00003,Anyone know where Morgana’s shirt is from in this episode?
3,qmttuh_00004,Was there always a laugh track? Or was it always so obtrusive? Maybe it's just actual live audience reactions but even then I found them kind of annoying. Could've also just been me not understanding what's so funny that was ticking me off. Like I just want to watch them do the task not all this other noise in the background. It's okay when they're talking on stage but otherwise it was an annoyance for me this episode.
4,qmttuh_00005,
5,qmttuh_00006,I predict VCM will not be able to play the swanee whistle.
6,qmttuh_00007,Absolutely shocked someone got a point in that game
7,qmttuh_00008,Power move by VCM
8,qmttuh_00009,Big up Cov & the West Mids Mandem - statement
9,qmttuh_00010,“My main thing is did you all have fun doing that?” You can tell Guz is a dad.
10,qmttuh_00011,"""If I can offer one criticism..."" ""YEEAH"""
11,qmttuh_00012,I'm enthralled by the way Morgana moves in tasks. She gestures like she's in stop motion or a muppet or something. It's great
12,qmttuh_00013,Genuinely didn't think it was possible to struggle that much with the concept of a swanee whistle
13,qmttuh_00014,Mr Greedy esq again. 🤣 I love VCM so much.
14,qmttuh_00015,Someone near me started setting off fireworks right at the end of the episode and I like to think it was in celebration of Victoria’s win.
15,qmttuh_00016,"Victoria a master of the battlefield that is the prize task, trapped Greg with a classic pincer movement, 10/10, well done."
16,qmttuh_00017,"Ooh, he said: “I want to drill down into the narrative.” That means Greg really liked Guz’s jingle."
17,qmttuh_00018,Victoria’s out here challenging Greg to 4D chess while the rest of them are playing checkers.
18,qmttuh_00019,Kerry Godliman and Greg are disgusted that Alan doesn't know what a laminator (the king of stationary) is.
19,qmttuh_00020,"""... and a snack to reward myself."""
20,qmttuh_00021,🚨 VCM EPISODE WIN 🚨
21,qmttuh_00022,Victoria is definitely entering Mr Greedy Esq. for a third prize task later in the series.
22,qmttuh_00023,
23,qmttuh_00024,VCM is the thickest smart person I've ever seen 😂
24,qmttuh_00025,I was really hoping that they'd get Greg to come along and look at the shelves in person - to get the perfect eyeline.
25,qmttuh_00026,"my personal top 5 highlights: the cut from Desiree having no idea how to make a jingle on drums to Guz being in the perfect minidrumkit flow state Alan loosing his shit over the sound of his instrument Alex suggesting Victoria should spin the piston faster the juxtaposition of Guzs and Alexs ""Tata, see you later!"" and of course! Victoria putting a pipe through the sponge: do you find this erotic? 1 second silence Alex (like a good little boy): Yes!"
26,qmttuh_00027,I love how supportive they are of VCM winning!!
27,qmttuh_00028,"""I've got it as an evil clown's face"" - ""You would have got a point, mate"" Greg setting himself up for a roast and Guz taking the opportunity was so good!"
28,qmttuh_00029,Morgana's was utter fucking batshit. Loved it.
29,qmttuh_00030,guz might have the best dynamic with alex of any contestant ever
30,qmttuh_00031,“Line. LIIIIIIIIINE. Line. Line. Line. Line.”
31,qmttuh_00032,"I feel like ""snakes in a can"" would fit in well in James Acaster's ""pants on a stick"" song"
32,qmttuh_00033,"""I like a good prod"" And with that, Morgana sent r/taskmaster in to meltdown"
33,qmttuh_00034,petition for a Mr Greedy Esquire flair
34,qmttuh_00035,"These final tasks this season really could use more playtesting. 2 tasks in a row now where noone/almost noone got any points.(and especially this task, they clearly gave people far too complex drawings)"
35,qmttuh_00036,"In general the tasks have honestly been quite poor this series. So much needless complication and a sense of ""just do things"" which makes it feel less like a competition. Push this through a pipe or put that on a shelf. No sense that you're going up against other competitors. But this cast, man...this cast. I adore them. Best cast since Series 7 (sorry Woz I love you)."
36,qmttuh_00037,"""This is going to be fun and a thing."" VCM your Mitchell is showing"
37,qmttuh_00038,I've never seen such a no nonsense sounding person on a more nonsense show than Victoria Coren Mitchell on Taskmaster.
38,qmttuh_00039,"Not the most interesting or spectacular episode, but still okay! Victoria bringing Greedy Esq again was a stroke of genius. I'm surprised the episode title wasn't ""Angry water cow"". That was good shit Also nearly spat out my water when I heard Guz say, ""I'm just writing messages to my friends now"". Man, Guz rocked that last task, and it wasn't because he was great at it <3 OH MY GOD VICTORIA FINALLY WON! <3 <3 I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT"
39,qmttuh_00040,Desiree deserved the 5 points for her jingle. Morgana should've ranked lower.
40,qmttuh_00041,Victoria trying to win with a previous failed prize.
41,qmttuh_00042,Why was Morgana's so weirdly erotic
42,qmttuh_00043,"I predict VCM will win today, going out on a limb."
43,qmttuh_00044,Absolutely brilliant prize task by Victoria. I don't remember a contestant ever bringing in the same prize twice lmao
44,qmttuh_00045,'Drill down into the narrative' sighting
45,qmttuh_00046,"2021 truly is silly season. Ronaldo to United, Messi to PSG, and Victoria Coren Mitchell winning an episode of Taskmaster."
46,qmttuh_00047,Victoria has beaten Greg at his own game! A-ha!
47,qmttuh_00048,There is no way that Victoria's original plan was to submit Greedy Esquire originally so I love that she brought him back.
48,qmttuh_00049,Snakes in a can 👉👉👉
49,qmttuh_00050,"So I am going to be humming Morgana's...""snakes in the can"" with finger snake guns..."
50,qmttuh_00051,The chemistry and camaraderie of this seasons cast is a joy to watch.
51,qmttuh_00052,The way Morgana celebrated Victoria's win! You'd think it was her who won! That was so heartwarming!
52,qmttuh_00053,"I’m not normally a huge VCM fan, but god do I relate to her on this show. She’d doing her utmost to be upbeat and jovial, but Greg keeps reading it as stern and bossy. And there’s no way to defend herself without seeming even more stern and bossy!"
53,qmttuh_00054,Does your brain ever go                        ❤             ❤                       ❤                        ❤          Morgana        ❤                     Robinson             ❤                       ❤                           ❤
54,qmttuh_00055,Was anyone else somehow awoken by Morgana’s dirty Berlin vibe?
55,qmttuh_00056,"Guz getting actual psychological help because of Taskmaster. I mean,, that’s understandable."
56,qmttuh_00057,"As a member of the west mids mandem (I'm from Dudley), I appreciated the shout-out from Guz"
57,qmttuh_00058,Why is Morgana asking Alex to Google how tall Greg is? She should be googling how tall Dara O'Brien is
58,qmttuh_00059,"I laughed harder than anything else this episode at ""big up cov and the west mids mandem"". Made even better that he labelled it ""statement"". I love this whole cast but Guz really takes it for me most days."
59,qmttuh_00060,
60,qmttuh_00061,I wonder when will Victoria trick David into wearing the dissolving swimming shorts? And when will that be a story on WILTY?
61,qmttuh_00062,THE FUCKING LAMINATOR
62,qmttuh_00063,That is not a jingle VCM
63,qmttuh_00064,One day Alex is going to say “all the information is on the task” and one of the contestants is going to straight up sucker punch him.
64,qmttuh_00065,"""Drill down into the narrative"" alert!"
65,qmttuh_00066,"""It gets harder the smaller it gets."" - Morgana"
66,qmttuh_00067,YES VCM!
67,qmttuh_00068,"""Your penis got tingly"" ""Did you laminate your penis"" Lol"
68,qmttuh_00069,I punched the air when VCM got her well deserved win tonight 💪🏻
69,qmttuh_00070,"When Greg went to talk to Victoria about the pipe task, she very much looked at him with an expression that said, “Never speak to me or Mr. Greedy, Esq. ever again.”"
70,qmttuh_00071,"Of all the things in this strange world that surprise me, Victoria saying ""I don't know how to put up a shelf"" is perhaps the least surprising thing of all."
71,qmttuh_00072,Guz is just straight vibing
72,qmttuh_00073,THE GREAT PUSH
73,qmttuh_00074,A dramatic reading by Morgana Robinson
74,qmttuh_00075,“Big up the West Midlands massive.” I fucking love Guz.
75,qmttuh_00076,"Also Greg was on FIRE this intro, one of my favorite ever. I love how Desiree was just dying Guz is one of the cutest humans alive, I just adore him Alan not being able to pop the balloon I was on the same wavelength as Alan this ep, I also interpreted ""put the pipe through the box and everything in it"" the exact same way, and also my mental drawings matched up with his in the studio task"
76,qmttuh_00077,LINE. LIIIIIIINE. Liiiiiiiine. Line. Line. Line.
77,qmttuh_00078,Discovering taskmaster was better than losing my virginity tbh
78,qmttuh_00079,"I am so curious to know what VCM’s childhood was like. Never learned to ride a bike. Didn’t know how to operate a slide whistle Whatever it was like, it has produced the best worst TM contestant and the worst best contestant. Actually, I think I’m convinced she’s always been who she is. It’s both delightful and frightening imagining a 7yo VCM"
79,qmttuh_00080,"I have no musical talent but here would be my lyrics for a laminator jingle: If you want to save your docs, And keep them safe for later, Get a l-a-m-i-n-a-t-o-r, See you later, Laminator! [slide whistle] “The Great Push” would be my choice for an episode title. I like the format of the live task but it was so hard I’m amazed there were any corrects. Maybe easier drawings? Castle was much too hard. Of all the bottom feeders in the show’s history, Victoria has to have the most moments of competence. When she’s good at something she’s really genuinely good at it. Whereas David Baddiel couldn’t even write a memorable song and you wondered if Katherine Parkinson could take care of herself on a day to day basis."
80,qmttuh_00081,"Disappointed none of the laminator jingles had asked the question: horse or laminator? ""Over your shoulder That's what I told ya Is that a horse Or a laminator?"""
81,qmttuh_00082,Bing Bong Bing!
82,qmttuh_00083,"Come on, I'm watching this hoping this may be Vicky's episode"
83,qmttuh_00084,Petition to have a Mr Greedy Esq user flair!!!
84,qmttuh_00085,"I went to the audience recording of these and completely forgot about Victoria's prize task, I absolutely pissed myself when it came up just now!"
85,qmttuh_00086,Guz has Jamali levels of shithousery
86,qmttuh_00087,"me, noticing we're on the 7th episode: oh wait, so these people aren't gonna entertain me every week for the rest of my life?"
87,qmttuh_00088,
88,qmttuh_00089,Guz looks so at peace playing those drums.
89,qmttuh_00090,LIIIIIIIIIINNNNEEE line
90,qmttuh_00091,VICTORIA!!!!!! SO PROUD OF HER.
91,qmttuh_00092,"And she gets to keep Mr. Greedy, esq!"
92,qmttuh_00093,"The greatest thing about tonight's was forgetting who won from the screenings back in May, but remembering Victoria's prize task, very enjoyable (obvs)"
93,qmttuh_00094,Beautiful move there VCM
94,qmttuh_00095,Morgana and I have the exact same attitude and aptitude for DIY.
95,qmttuh_00096,I really hope we will see Morgana (not playing a character) more often on panel shows! She is awesome!
96,qmttuh_00097,"I’m not saying I’m a simp for Victoria, but I do want to buy snakes in a can now."
97,qmttuh_00098,Alex's hype man work could do with some improvement tbh
98,qmttuh_00099,The first 4 seconds of Guz's jingle were the best television in a long time.
99,qmttuh_00100,"anyone else think that if morgana could have, she would have thrown the live task so VCM could win? she was cheering so loud when VCM won 🥺❤️"
100,qmttuh_00101,Morgana forgetting Greg’s name was incredible.
101,qmttuh_00102,VCM is alpha level passive aggressive!
102,qmttuh_00103,Mad that Morgana has the Christmas number 1 in the bag now
103,qmttuh_00104,Guz is the best thing to happen to Taskmaster
104,qmttuh_00105,"I think the tasks this series seem more, like... fun. I don't know how to describe it, and no shade to previous series, but these honestly feel like just games that are really fun and you'd want to have a go at al of them. Not a single ""I'd hate to do that"" task in the bunch so far (except the eating mayonnaise, but, as a North American, I'm with Desiree that those things just do not qualify as food to me lol)"
105,qmttuh_00106,"I'm loving this season, nobody's going middle-of-the-road boring effectiveness to rack up points, instead everyone is bringing their A game comedy wise and managing to go neck and neck while being genuinely friendly with each other. Apart from Victoria's last place, but she's also incredibly funny and takes it very well while still not throwing tasks on purpose. I don't even know who I would want to win, I'm torn between Guz and Morgana atm. They really should playtest their tasks more though, and how many times has it been now that shorter contestants, i.e women, are not taken into account at all? Sian Gibson, Nicola Coughlan and Morgana just off the top of my head had something set up way too high for them."
106,qmttuh_00107,"Here's a tweak I just thought of for the pipe task. Have the tasks split into two task envelopes, both of which the contestants see. Alex says ""You have two tasks to complete. Choose either envelope you want to begin with."" They open either ""Pass the pipe through the box and all of its contents"" or ""pass the box and all of its contents through the pipe."" He never tells them they have to do one before opening the other, so they could open both at the start to figure out the optimal strategy. Or they could pass the box and contents through the pipes and then discover they have to pass the pipe through the destroyed and shredded stuff."
107,qmttuh_00108,"Always late to watch but, Great season still. One of my favorites. Love that Victoria won an episode as she’s definitely been my favorite contestant this season. I thought she was a bit robbed on the jingle task honestly, but I’ve never even a huge fan of the song and dance type tasks so who knows. I still get the impression that Greg has a bit of a crush on Morganna. Who can blame him. Only real gripe is that I really wish they would like.. “play test” the live tasks more maybe? It seems like quite a few this season have had some fundamental flaw that would be easily solved just by playing through it once with the crew. I think you easily could have added words like “from” and “to” to the live task pool and it still would have been tricky/funny, just more doable."
108,qmttuh_00109,HAHAHAHA YES VICTORIA.
109,qmttuh_00110,"After the prize task I already thought ""this is Victorias chance"". I'm really glad she won this week. I'm not sure what is going on with the live tasks at the moment, but Alex must have been so happy when Alan guessed the spider correctly. Guz completely ignoring the task after the third round was hilarious. I think Alan was a bit underscored this episode to be honest, I thought his jingle was the best (this might be laminator bias though) and I would have done the exact same thing when asked to put the pipe through the box and everything in it. All in all it was a great episode, always love a good old music task"
110,qmttuh_00111,"Morgana's vocals were a bit Kraftwerk there, very into it"
111,qmttuh_00112,VCM just getting a snack is a mood.
112,qmttuh_00113,YES ALAN AND VICTORIA.
113,qmttuh_00114,"Alan did put the pipe through ""the box and everything in it."" Does not say ""through each thing in it."" Moreover, once they take the things out of the box, there are no things left in the box that need either to be passed through the pipe or to have the pipe passed through, Alex."
114,qmttuh_00115,Greg's drilling down into the narrative!
115,qmttuh_00116,Wheyyyy predicted it! First comment on this post 😁
116,qmttuh_00117,"I’d watch this cast read the phonebook! Love them all individually, but appreciate their group dynamic and camaraderie even more."
117,qmttuh_00118,Desiree smashed it.
118,qmttuh_00119,I admire Victoria just casually getting a snack
119,qmttuh_00120,VCM ♥ Mr Greedy Esq
120,qmttuh_00121,"I was so glad Victoria won this episode. She's really growing on me as a contestant and I like to see her succeed against all odds. The ""put the box through the pipe, etc."" task was confounding. The way it was edited and discussed afterwards didn't really clarify much. I feel like Guz didn't get a fair shot to argue his method. The last task with the blind drawings was really fun, especially the way they would interpret their scribbles. But the jump from something simple like banana to castle and Greg made it seem like it was designed to fail. Morgana definitely sold me on snakes in a can. She could probably sell me anything, to be honest."
121,qmttuh_00122,"Little does Guz know that they did pretty much that exact ""find Alex"" task in TMNZ S2, where they filled the house with Paul look-a-likes and had to find the real Paul"
122,qmttuh_00123,That studio task has great potential but to end up with almost nothing after last week 0 point socerer is a bit of a downer. Congrats to VCM at last!
123,qmttuh_00124,VCM FTW!
124,qmttuh_00125,
125,qmttuh_00126,"Anyone else thought during the first task that there was maybe a pitfall? When the task said ""for all of the taskmaster snooker balls"" I was like maybe they should have put up only the red balls or something like that?"
126,qmttuh_00127,"""I like a good prod."" - Morgana"
127,qmttuh_00128,Left banana
128,qmttuh_00129,"Victoria won? How did that happen? Good to see her win at least an episode. If it becomes obvious someone's not going to win the series, I go for them at least winning one episode to compensate."
129,qmttuh_00130,"Not gonna lie, after her performance in the last few weeks, i never thought i'd see Victoria win an episode"
130,qmttuh_00131,Morgana's hair in her video was the most ridiculous thing indeed. Anti-gravity.
131,qmttuh_00132,The Laminatator shows itself again!!
132,qmttuh_00133,That stylophone is bringing me back to James Acaster's netflix special
133,qmttuh_00134,DRILL DOWN INTO THE NARRATIVE
134,qmttuh_00135,A N G R Y W A T E R C O W
135,qmttuh_00136,You have no idea how much joy I felt when I realised we would be getting more laminator themed songs!
136,qmttuh_00137,I'm so happy! And now I know how not to pronounce snooker. Live and learn and have a snack!
137,qmttuh_00138,Taaaaskmaster's oooooon. Iiiiiit is on nooooooow.
138,qmttuh_00139,I love how much Desiree enjoys Greg’s Alex abuse.
139,qmttuh_00140,VCM where was the jingle!?
140,qmttuh_00141,Guz is so entrancing
141,qmttuh_00142,"Love VCM in the prize task, her pointing out he said it was ridiculous already was just perfect. I would also really like to see the Where Alex task now with him dressed as Wally/Waldo"
142,qmttuh_00143,Greg will enjoy a jingle about laminators.
143,qmttuh_00144,I'm surprised VCM has never been on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and played a round of swanee / kazoo.
144,qmttuh_00145,Pissing myself at Guz's Where's Wally? task idea.
145,qmttuh_00146,Victoria immediately taking her glasses off 😂
146,qmttuh_00147,Big up cov & the west midlands
147,qmttuh_00148,I bet she is thrilled to have Mr Greedy back
148,qmttuh_00149,"That please followed by you are an asshole, and then her self-revelation!! Morgana"
149,qmttuh_00150,THE SNAKES IN A CAN VIDEO I CANT J CANJHNQNSN
150,qmttuh_00151,"I’ve been a vegetarian since I was 6, but Desiree’s crab sticks jingle genuinely made me want a crab stick."
151,qmttuh_00152,"That was the most aggressive, and yet cool jingle for a laminator I’ve ever seen."
152,qmttuh_00153,It's always the sponge.
153,qmttuh_00154,She gets to take home Mr Greedy Esquire!
154,qmttuh_00155,that live task was legendary
155,qmttuh_00156,"My thoughts on the jingle task... Alan: Makes laminating your grandfather's will look cool and a sound investment. Desiree: The 90's, skating grannies and crab sticks...oh, the good old days. Gus: ""I'm Like a Laminator""--Guzzie Khan feat. Alex ""MC Ham Sandwich"" Horne. What a ham. Morgana: On that minimalist Berlin vibe. Snakes. Gun. Victoria: If I saw this on TV, I would facepalm like Greg. And die from facepalm overdose. And have her organize my funeral. Bonus--Greg: She [Desiree] must know, she must know about your little pink blotches that you keep secret. Always in spring, isn't it, that it appears? Alex: The blotches? Greg: Yeah, it really is clockwork. Oh, look, the snowdrops have just faded away...Yep! RIGHT!"
156,qmttuh_00157,Are we in for a VCM episode win?
157,qmttuh_00158,Guz and Alan might have the advantage in this task as we all know how much Greg loves a laminator.
158,qmttuh_00159,VCM looking like me trying to smoke
159,qmttuh_00160,Morgana really is just a quote machine. Everything she says is iconic!
160,qmttuh_00161,"What is a water cow, Guz?"
161,qmttuh_00162,Desiree got Jebus from the simpsons :-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxWkcAUykUo
162,qmttuh_00163,"Laminate Laminate is going to live in my head rent free for the rest of time, holy fuck I was howling"
163,qmttuh_00164,
164,qmttuh_00165,"I'll never get over LAH little silly face, I live for it"
165,qmttuh_00166,Guz found a spear.
166,qmttuh_00167,"Much more entertaining than last week's paper airplanes, even if no-one wins. I'd play this game."
167,qmttuh_00168,Alan \0/.
168,qmttuh_00169,Finally!!!
169,qmttuh_00170,"The jingle task stole the show. Guz has really grown on me too. I feel like even though the cast seems super chill and friendly with one another, I feel like Greg is still sassy which always makes me happy."
170,qmttuh_00171,Favourite ever intro to Alex.
171,qmttuh_00172,Snucker balls.
172,qmttuh_00173,"Pictures of your family and friends, or g-strings."
173,qmttuh_00174,Victoria doing well this episode 😭 I feel like she needs this for her self-esteem
174,qmttuh_00175,"Couldn’t they remove everything from the box, then put the pipe through the box with everything in it (which is nothing) and then put the box with everything in it (still nothing) through the pipe?"
175,qmttuh_00176,"I am enjoying the woodworking competition show they have on before Taskmaster on Channel 4. Mel Geidroyc is such a lovely presenter of these craft-competition shows, nothing fazes her, she is just as serenely good-natured as she was on Taskmaster. Also, I keep wondering what would happen if you gave Guz and Victoria a chisel and a block of wood and told them to make some spoons. I suspect much blood would be shed."
176,qmttuh_00177,Victoria is fearless
177,qmttuh_00178,Alan really is the grandad of the contestants.
178,qmttuh_00179,desiree.exe is not responding
179,qmttuh_00180,"""a bit of rubber action"" - alan davies"
180,qmttuh_00181,I almost bought some crab sticks today. Advertising works
181,qmttuh_00182,I guess we finally got Vic on TM

184,qmttuh_00185,Morgana Morgana Morgana Morgana Morgana!!!!!!!
185,qmttuh_00186,"I'm glad that advert is there, I had no idea about Google Translate."
186,qmttuh_00187,Those aren't all of the taskmasters balls are they?
187,qmttuh_00188,VCM in first place. I can't believe what I am seeing here!
188,qmttuh_00189,YES A MUSICAL TASK.
189,qmttuh_00190,"Let's see I Alan can top ""Calendar day"" by Laura..."
190,qmttuh_00191,Ah I have missed the music challenges
191,qmttuh_00192,I need to buy some snakes in a can now.
192,qmttuh_00193,ALEXS WILL I CANT BREATHE
193,qmttuh_00194,I fucking love a laminator
194,qmttuh_00195,"Hey Greg, I'm Welsh and I can assure you that is definitely how we pronounce snooker in the valleys."
195,qmttuh_00196,It’s so exciting how close the overall season scores are now!!! I like that there’s not a clear front runner.
196,qmttuh_00197,Morgana’s snakes in a can jingle gave me really strong Peaches vibes (NSFW). We love our innuendo queen 👑👑
197,qmttuh_00198,I believe we watched this one back in May. Very enjoyable stuff
198,qmttuh_00199,Morgana’s prize just made me bump Vic Reeves up my dream contestants list.
199,qmttuh_00200,And we have the episode title!
200,qmttuh_00201,YEAH.
201,qmttuh_00202,Crabsticks. A seminal masterpiece. 10/10
202,qmttuh_00203,5 points to Desiree.
203,qmttuh_00204,"""i like a good prod"""
204,qmttuh_00205,I don't believe it
205,qmttuh_00206,What is she doing to that poor mannequin?!
206,qmttuh_00207,Was Victoria about to cry in the jingle task? :(
207,qmttuh_00208,"I had 2 real jump scares when Victoria opened her jingle item, did anyone else have the same experience?"
208,qmttuh_00209,"Lol I assume most of you guys in this thread aren't Americans but funnily enough if you do find yourself in NYC and were to say BING BONG you would actually fit in 🤣🤣 it's become a meme for New York Knicks fans to say because it's the sound the New York MTA Subway trains make when the doors close. Video where the meme started: https://youtu.be/mkhrUM35CQo?t=21 Also what a great episode! Usually I'm too lazy to go to this thread because in Pacific time by the time it's Thursday evening and I torrent the episode it's well past prime time when the episode aired in the UK. But Victoria's hilarious mannerisms and Disiree's Americanness brought me to this thread. I really like Disiree's American background and although I've never heard of her (besides her being the narrator of American dating show I've heard of), I think the show could use more American comedians! Can you imagine Conan O Brien or Wayne Brady or Bill Burr or Dave Chapelle or Ali Wong or Bo Burnham with his musical and lyrical talents as a contestant?? It would be hilarious. I also realized I could play along on the final task and these are these are my results! https://imgur.com/N2ivtEl The closest I got to a point was my guess of house for Desiree's Castle. Also in retrospect I definitely understood where VCM was going and Morgana was genius to use tone with her harp drawing instructions but she should have started with short lownote ""line""s, transitioned to midlength midnote ""line""s, and then transitioned to short highnote ""line""s. Also did nobody notice how Morgana spelled aeroplane airoplane for one of her guesses LOL like some kinda American spelling of a British pronunciation. TL;DR: American likes American culture. You can also play along as contestant for the final stage task of the show. The American also has some theories of how the contestants could have done better."
209,qmttuh_00210,Was Wet Wet Wet originally called Wet Wet Wet Wet Wet?
210,qmttuh_00211,What does it take to get a flair? Bc I desperately need a Morgana flair
211,qmttuh_00212,Trying to balance snooker balls on a shelf that is nowhere near straight. Incredible.
212,qmttuh_00213,"He's a big boy, don't underestimate him!"
213,qmttuh_00214,Desiree with a near death experience.
214,qmttuh_00215,"Have to say, don’t think wearing safety goggles will protect them from snooker balls falling from a height."
215,qmttuh_00216,Something tells me Guz will either dominate this task or absolutely tank it
216,qmttuh_00217,"Crabsticks do not actually contain any crab, and from 1993 manufacturers have been legally obliged to label them ‘crab-flavoured’ sticks."
217,qmttuh_00218,Oof washed out picture again?
218,qmttuh_00219,'aaay! Taskmaster Adverts are back!
219,qmttuh_00220,That was a dreadful task
220,qmttuh_00221,Why limit them to a specific instrument??
221,qmttuh_00222,"Ooh, this is like the Christmas task on TMNZ series 2."
222,qmttuh_00223,this has been the best episode of the series so far
223,qmttuh_00224,Morgana's got a blockage.
224,qmttuh_00225,A castle is mental.
225,qmttuh_00226,I LOL'd at that one harder than any in the season so far; I LOVE this cast.
226,qmttuh_00227,"VCM didn't win the episode with her prize task, so shouldn't she have lost it????"
227,qmttuh_00228,After watching TMNZ I wanted to see half points
228,qmttuh_00229,This is the same task in series 2 taskmaster nz
229,qmttuh_00230,BINGBONGBING
230,qmttuh_00231,Greg keeps talking over Alex today. Poor Little Alex!
231,qmttuh_00232,You would've got the point mate
232,qmttuh_00233,what's the title of the music in the first tasK?
233,qmttuh_00234,Guess that's the closest we get to having Vic Reeves on the show right now
234,qmttuh_00235,Have they all been made to wear safety boots for this one?

238,qmttuh_00239,That was a great task
239,qmttuh_00240,"Ah, you bastard."
240,qmttuh_00241,I'm not sure I want to look at the Google advert task. It's not in the spirit of Greg's outros...
241,qmttuh_00242,I'd love a double big mac right about now.
242,qmttuh_00243,Did the tube task make anyone else need a poo?

1,qmw83k_00002,"whoever runs the youtube channel now has seriously downgraded the experience. these may all be minor quibbles, I agree, but it's on its way to go to shit. firstly, the episode titles no longer appear in the youtube video title. it was a nice option in earlier series to just reveal the youtube title while watching and match up with when it was uttered in the show. secondly, the mini-videos of S12 seems to clog the queue. I've just seen the episode with the riddle, mate. as much as I love her appearance on the series, why would I want to see a short 6 minute video of just Victoria Coren-Mitchell solving it again a day later? and that too, what's up with that video having no revelations? lastly, the ads are just everywhere now. earlier in the year the ads would align perfectly with the breaks, no problem there at all. now we get three ad breaks per task! the worst part is the jarring juxtaposition of the carefully crafted task theme music against the jingle of the ""tat"" being sold. (yeah, I know, I could pay to take away ads or view the episode from another non-ad-playing app, but those are wonky workarounds as far as I'm concerned.)"

1,qru9p5_00002,This episode had probably one of my favourite Introductions from Greg. Cracked me up.
2,qru9p5_00003,I lost it every time they cut to Alan during the upside down face task. He looked so bewildered.
3,qru9p5_00004,I am scared
4,qru9p5_00005,"I think this episode had one of the best ""final task of the show""! So simple, yet soooooo entertaining! I was actually on the edge of my seat during the balloon inflation and going ""gettt uppp Desiree!! It's going to burst any second!!"""

6,qru9p5_00007,I'd love to watch Victoria and Katherine talk about sports.
7,qru9p5_00008,The bell task is deliciously unfair because anyone who got both parts of it wrong will still have got points :D
8,qru9p5_00009,One of the best studio tasks surely. Incredible.

11,qru9p5_00012,"I feel like I remember Alex saying on the podcast a while back that Alan’s first task resulted in him just sitting confused in the caravan for the whole task, I guess this is it."

14,qru9p5_00015,Morgana doing Dour 1980s' Scottish Fitba Commentator was a stroke of genius.
15,qru9p5_00016,"There was something so pure about Victoria taking the ""element of surprise"" and just running it into the ground by doing like 27 different surprising things in 60 seconds. We had, what, the animal yell, the traffic cones, Alan having to defend the goal with his back turned, the unfulfilled looking-down-top, and I think something else? And then of course none of that is what Alan had meant by element of surprise. I don't know, it was very sweet."
16,qru9p5_00017,Desiree's scream 😂😂😂

31,qru9p5_00032,I think Victoria has surpassed Hugh Dennis's reputation about not giving a fuck about the prize task
32,qru9p5_00033,"Didn't expect ""look down my top"" from Victoria."
33,qru9p5_00034,Wilkinson hits a hole in one. Wilkinson is disqualified. Hahahaha I love it.

37,qru9p5_00038,I honestly don’t think I could love Victoria more. She is very quickly becoming one of my all time favourite TM contestants. She is absolutely hilarious. Just watching now and I’m crying at sports day.
38,qru9p5_00039,"Would love Suzie Dent as a contestant, running rings around LAH over the wording of tasks"
39,qru9p5_00040,"The headlines, or whatever you'd call them, on Alan and Victoria's sports show. You can see ""Wilkinson hits hole in one"" immediately followed by ""Wilkinson Disqualified"". Some time before that you can see ""Laminator 13-1""."

50,qru9p5_00051,"I haven't read through all the comments here, but I'm assuming everyone else wants a Greg-in-the-box, too. If that Taskmaster tune was really playing out of it, then it should have been the perfect cue on when to pop up (Victoria got it). I was really rooting for Desiree to get in before the balloon explosion (it seemed like it lingered at that same size for awhile). I was laughing so hard when Greg asked to see that shot of Alan with the googly eyes on his chin and that long drawn out violin note. It was such a wistful moment during the VT."
51,qru9p5_00052,The balloon task. I can’t. It killed me. The fact that they were all looking at the balloon knowing full well it was going to pop but all still flailed madly when it did cracked me up. Desiree’s reaction especially cracked me up. Absolute belter of an episode.
52,qru9p5_00053,"Did alex really say ""Snot as easy as you think"" for the last nose blowing feather tie break??"
53,qru9p5_00054,omg alan's existential crisis during the upside-down face task had me in stitches. top-tier episode imo. one that you can recommend to someone new to the series.

55,qru9p5_00056,"I thought they were going to commentate on the other team's sport, but I realized the logistics of that didn't really work unless they had multiple team task days. Like there's no way they would've had film for both sports on both commentary days."
56,qru9p5_00057,Watching that balloon was incredibly stressful
57,qru9p5_00058,I'm mad at myself for not realising they couldn't see each other in the studio task. On all three rounds I was annoyed that the fifth person didn't stand up right after the fourth person.

73,qru9p5_00074,Was really hoping Victoria could bridge the gap but I think she’s definitely got last place now
74,qru9p5_00075,Greg has been pretty generous with the points this season. 5 points for the sports task for everyone? Has the taskmaster become weak?
75,qru9p5_00076,"well I've realized now that 3 weeks ago I was close, but it's after the last 2 episodes that I've fully realized what's at my Morgana familiarity. Purely looks-wise, she's reminding me of Susan Sarandon (I mentioned Bettie Davis before, and Sarandon played Davis in that miniseries), but on certain body language/expressions/behavior moments, I've been getting a sort of Jessica Knappett flavor from her. And Knappett and Rose Matafeo are possibly equally my two favorite contestants ever, so makes sense I'm loving Morgana."

81,qru9p5_00082,I love the Susie Dent check in.
82,qru9p5_00083,The Wilkinson hits hole in one and then updated to Wilkinson disqualified is beautiful.
83,qru9p5_00084,"One of the best things about TM is that the contestants cannot hide behind their usual TV personas for very long. And that means that Victoria is just absolutely adorable. Shes very smart about particular things, endearingly clumsy with others, but never short of confidence."
84,qru9p5_00085,I thought the studio task was going to be shit but it was great!
85,qru9p5_00086,I feel like the minus 5 in that task was kinda unnecessary...
86,qru9p5_00087,How is Alan doing so well?!
87,qru9p5_00088,"That double negative thing was quite cheeky!! Opposite of the following is kinda sneaky pasta!! I was so proud that I was in august company of VCM and DB! It's Karma, boo!"
88,qru9p5_00089,"In a weird way, I sort of wish Alan was my dad. Or at least that lovable yet strange uncle that you see on family get togethers."
89,qru9p5_00090,How far down the task does doing the opposite apply? Will the winner be the slowest to do the wrong thing??
90,qru9p5_00091,Katherine Parkinson already won this task 2 seasons ago.
91,qru9p5_00092,This is a better take of the similar NZ one. No live audience reaction to hint when someone has stood.
92,qru9p5_00093,"Morgana’s in the lead for the series? A lot of horny people would be happy about that. But it’s still really close, though."
93,qru9p5_00094,"Did anyone else think that the answers were incorrect for the opposite bell ring game? Shouldn't it technically have been: ""YOU did the WRONG thing"" because it was about doing the exact opposite? Was it just me?"
94,qru9p5_00095,"If Greedy, Esquire makes another appearance this week I am DEMANDING we get a replica of him in the Taskmaster store online for us all to purchase and love at home."
95,qru9p5_00096,"To be fair to Victoria, a magician would really liven up a game of football for me."
96,qru9p5_00097,"Wonderful season still. There’s something about it that I’ve realized, and it’s that this season more than any other I really look at any episode and think “yep, I could easily introduce someone to the show with this one”. Which is a unique thing. There are many seasons with great episodes and contestants, but there will be a task that’s kind of not my type or maybe some particular banter or a bad prod round. This season is so consistent. Though as an aside, the more I watch the more I get the sense that Alan genuinely did not love being paired with Victoria for tasks lol. I love the both of them, but he’s such an Everyman in a way and she’s so.. unique in her thought process."
97,qru9p5_00098,I love Guz's shithousery
98,qru9p5_00099,I was so distracted by the headlines to pay attention to the task... Nell vs. Ducky was my favourite
99,qru9p5_00100,Vindaloovians! Isn't that right Bhindi Bhaji?
100,qru9p5_00101,Morganna ass cream is a perfect fit for the prize task. I use it on rashes between my thighs sometimes and it works like a charm.
101,qru9p5_00102,This would be Josh Widdicombe's nightmare
102,qru9p5_00103,The studio task was a much better version of the toast studio task from Taskmaster NZ. I was holding my breath the entire time!!
103,qru9p5_00104,"For that live task they took what NZ did and then improved on what was wrong with that task. Poor Victoria losing those five, she needed them to bridge the gap. Looks like its become a 3 horse race now."
104,qru9p5_00105,"Anyone else think they're not meant to say ""I did the right thing""?"
105,qru9p5_00106,Woo Susie Dent as task consultant
106,qru9p5_00107,"Okay, I would have no practical use for it day-to-day, but I fucking want that balloon inflating machine."
107,qru9p5_00108,This balloon round is giving me anxiety.
108,qru9p5_00109,Did Victoria WEAR the popcorn necklace though?
109,qru9p5_00110,Don't put bum cream on your face if it has hydrocortisone in it!! It will thin your skin which is bad times
110,qru9p5_00111,"Great ep! but I'm becoming less of a fan of these mixed tasks where there are 2 components to score. the sports task this ep, last week we had: put the balls on Greg's eyeline height and fastest time wins, paint the ball green: neatest and fastest wins,...."
111,qru9p5_00112,This is such a good season. NZ Series 2 was so good too. Taskmaster is a good show that makes me happy.
112,qru9p5_00113,Why do I get the feeling someone will want a six foot eight crow to jump on them?
113,qru9p5_00114,This was just designed to get VCM to negative numbers wasn't it
114,qru9p5_00115,"Almost certainly not the place to say this, but I don't understand why they insist on tasks such as this. It's so much more enjoyable watching comedians being funny and creative instead of all 5 contestants having to rigidly do the exact same thing. Weirdly these types of tasks seem to be Alex's favourite so what do I know."
115,qru9p5_00116,Alan really showing his age. It's like being on holiday in the 70s
116,qru9p5_00117,"“She [Morgana] is quite a wild one when she’s not on the pitch, that’s for sure.” Confirmed."
117,qru9p5_00118,Alan having a full breakdown
118,qru9p5_00119,"Oh, this is like the TMNZ toaster pop round. Nice that Alex is taking inspiration from some of the other TM iterations!"
119,qru9p5_00120,[The Vindaloovians] https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jSZbzIHGj8U) have invaded Alex’s caravan!
120,qru9p5_00121,"Torn between laughing my head off and facepalming at bread bin (and the way she said it). Oh man, Victoria <3 Not sure if that Morgana deserved a bit more, especially as Desiree also said it worked... I mean, the brief just says most unexpected use and he definitely wasn't expecting what she used it for! Guz: ""This is gonna summon something!"" I'm a little confused. The task was ""You must under no circumstances not avoid* (cancels out) not making the bell not ring"" (double negative), which shortens to ""You must, under no circumstances, make the bell ring"" (5 negatives, as alex said). But then the task ALSO said ""You must do the OPPOSITE of the following, so isn't that a 6th negative, meaning that they SHOULD have rung the bell? Edit: Ah yeah, Alex, you baiting little shit. I should finish watching the whole ep before commenting GOLF CLUB BOXING?! Guz, wtf? HAHAHA. ""That's karma, boo!"" Element of surprise! Also Joe's potato throw will never not be old <3, THAT was a surprise Make your face look like another face upside down - can't help but remember Noel's googly eyes in the prize task and how cute it made everything look xD The live task had one of the few times I was absolutely sure of something - that the jack would only pop up AFTER the theme was done! And wow, what a great task in general, definitely intensely suspenseful there! Desiree's reaction to the balloon popping was hilarious, and so was Greg's! Desiree's fallen a little behind now, but the top three still separated by only a single point! Victoria's now placed last in 5 out of 8 episodes (62.5%), which puts her in 3rd place in the ""% of episodes in last place"" stakes (below Nish on 75% and Roisin on 66.6%, but above Charlotte on 60%). 1st is out of reach as of the last episode, but 2nd's still on the table"

122,qru9p5_00123,"Desiree reeling around wailing ""Nothing is ever going to be okay ever again"" is a serious 2021 Mood."

124,qru9p5_00125,"Oh, so this is a team task of commenting on a previous task? That’s really interesting!"
125,qru9p5_00126,Can anyone see who the group photo is?
126,qru9p5_00127,I'm looking forward to GuzBall becoming a mainstream sport from now on
127,qru9p5_00128,I love Desree telling the task to fuck off as she tries to work it the madness of it out.
128,qru9p5_00129,I definitely think the tasks are becoming too wordy and confusing
129,qru9p5_00130,Wilkinson disqualified 😁😁
130,qru9p5_00131,You can tell Alan watches sport with his commentary

137,qru9p5_00138,Strong task list this episode I thought
138,qru9p5_00139,Best episode this series by a long way Thoroughly enjoyable and a throwback to the classics
139,qru9p5_00140,"What Victoria has in riddle solving, she does not have in popcorn necklace making."
140,qru9p5_00141,Good thing Guz already has four kids. Probably can’t have any more now.

143,qru9p5_00144,😂😂😂😂
144,qru9p5_00145,Victoria and her prizes...
145,qru9p5_00146,"The bell ringing part of the task reminds me of my own ideas about the art of English and the science of English. The character and variety of the language is beautiful but no one gives a shit about the technical side, unless you're a linguist...or in Taskmaster. With that said, I mucked it up when I heard it the first time. Also, I feel Victoria has gained that same sort of apathy with the prize tasks like Rhod Gilbert had at the time, if I'm right to say this. She may have peaked at the customized inhaler but Rhod spams Greg up like no one's business! Bonus--Alex: ...so you end up with ""you must, under no circumstances, make the bell ring."" Morgana: Aw, shitsticks. :-( Alex: Just wondering, Susie, did you include the first line which was : ""do the opposite of the following""? Morgana: (does a happy dance) :-) Bonus 2--Desiree: Yeah, but I mean, you know, your balls can be damaged here but if your balls damaged up here (pointing to head) that's where the real problem comes in, man. (motivational stuff here)"
146,qru9p5_00147,"Okay, this first task is pissing me off already."

149,qru9p5_00150,WILKINSON DISQUALIFIED!!!
150,qru9p5_00151,The Easter eggs were my fave bit of the screenings!
151,qru9p5_00152,"So this is a more general show comment, but I'll say it here as it doesn't feel like it warrants its own post. It's just that it's only now just occurred to me how they must handle all the logistical details for tie breaker situations. Initially I was thinking they must've done 10 different tasks across location shooting that are all dedicated for TB'ers (after all, while it's hardly likely, they do have to be ready for the situation of each episode needing one), but that's not necessarily true. There's at least one TB I can think of that they did live in studio, during series 7 (the number written on Alex's arm). So they'd presumably do maybe like 5-6 different TB dedicated tasks while location shooting, and they certainly wouldn't use the same one for two different people later on in the series than who might've done it before. It would technically be a different experience of contestants doing the things, but they wouldn't want the audience to have to see a repeated task, full stop. But the finer point that only just hit me is they have to be strict at the time that they devise the tie breaker tasks for which episodes they'll potentially correlate to later on. Because especially for the ones pre-taped on location, obviously the production team already knows who did the best there, and so with picking the ones used in the moment, you could essentially rig a given single episode's winner. If Alan and Victoria end up in a tie, it must already be decided pre-taping for the studio show what the potential TB'er will be, cause otherwise they could simply pick whatever one Alan or Victoria did the best at to make sure they win the episode."
152,qru9p5_00153,"Saw this one back in May as part of the recordings. Very, very enjoyable."
153,qru9p5_00154,"""back massager"" from Morgana?"
154,qru9p5_00155,So that will be 1 point for Victoria
155,qru9p5_00156,Oh my god. I forgot it said to do the opposite. Leave it to Taskmaster to bamboozle us again.
156,qru9p5_00157,Wooo negative scores!
157,qru9p5_00158,SURPRISE.
158,qru9p5_00159,Did I miss something or was there actually no benefit to waiting further after the forth person had popped up?
159,qru9p5_00160,A 6'8 crow sounds pretty cool tbh.
160,qru9p5_00161,The minus points have actually annoyed me...
161,qru9p5_00162,Don't let Katherine Ryan hear about this task
162,qru9p5_00163,Sheffield Wednesday winning a game is the biggest surprise here
163,qru9p5_00164,JOE WILKINSON
164,qru9p5_00165,Anyone spot on the multisport VT the reference to The potato incident? :)
165,qru9p5_00166,POP!
166,qru9p5_00167,Gosh did I need this one today!
167,qru9p5_00168,"Don’t know about everyone else, but I’m personally still buzzing from VCM’s win last week."
168,qru9p5_00169,I have bought seafood sticks since last week's episode. Power of advertising!
169,qru9p5_00170,"Oh god, we're in danger"
170,qru9p5_00171,Schwarzenegger as the Taskmaster is actually so funny
171,qru9p5_00172,Morgana: Arse cream.
172,qru9p5_00173,"This task confused me 5 months ago, and still does now..."
173,qru9p5_00174,Guz is my absolute favourite - his whole response to this task is too funny.
174,qru9p5_00175,"Right, I can't be bothered to work it out. Place your bets: ring the bell or don't? I reckon it will be don't."
175,qru9p5_00176,I would love some Taskmaster branded batting pads
176,qru9p5_00177,"Genuinely fuck you Taskmaster, Norwich 3 - 1 Ipswich at the bottom, why you gotta attack me like that"
177,qru9p5_00178,"Wow, well done to Alex's favourite team Chesham smashing Spurs"
178,qru9p5_00179,That Wilkinson reference! 🤣
179,qru9p5_00180,"I'm even more upset that the incoming results were just references and jokes EXCEPT Ipswich losing to Norwich, fuck you"
180,qru9p5_00181,This task is made for Morgana
181,qru9p5_00182,With her minus points...could Victoria possibly set a new record for the lowest score in an episode? Currently sitting at 1 point with two tasks left
182,qru9p5_00183,
183,qru9p5_00184,Greg Davies taking a leaf out of Babben's book with the points this episode

186,qru9p5_00187,I believe Morgana is using bum cream on her eyes
187,qru9p5_00188,"Knowing Victoria, she probably did solve the moment she read it."
188,qru9p5_00189,Shitsticks 🤣
189,qru9p5_00190,I forgot about the do the opposite
190,qru9p5_00191,The Updates are full Easter eggs. Awesome!
191,qru9p5_00192,I'm trying to recall which international version the sextuple negative ring the bell task was taken from. Was it Bast i Test?
192,qru9p5_00193,Bwaha Greg calling out twitter.
193,qru9p5_00194,Are those waitrose essential tortilla wraps? Why would they be essential?
194,qru9p5_00195,Ring the bell or dont ring the bell. You have a 50% chance of being right. Just take the gamble instead of trying to understand the words.
195,qru9p5_00196,This isn't the most thrilling bit of telly I've ever seen.
196,qru9p5_00197,Oh Alan...
197,qru9p5_00198,Guz’s is a hairy old guy.
198,qru9p5_00199,"Wait, but couldn't ""under no circumstances"" also mean ""never""? So in the case the phrase would be ""You must never make the bell ring"", to which the opposite would be ""You must make the bell ring"", thus making Victoria and Des the winners of that challenge???"
199,qru9p5_00200,These double double double negatives are right up Victoria’s grammatical alley.
200,qru9p5_00201,This takes me back to when my Nan used to make me thread her needles for her because her eyes were fucked.
201,qru9p5_00202,Are Popcorn Necklaces an actual thing? I'm confused...
202,qru9p5_00203,This means Victoria is competing with Katherine Parkinson for worst score again

210,qru9p5_00211,These tasks are getting too complicated and convoluted! Bring back simplicity.

2,qrwkjh_00003,"help a sister out, is there a google drive link? :'("
0,qwzq61_00001,I wanna say is Morgana was looking incredible this episode. Make up game strong.
1,qwzq61_00002,I NEED someone to compile all of Alan's smirks.
2,qwzq61_00003,Could they have phoned the Talking Clock?
3,qwzq61_00004,
4,qwzq61_00005,"I'm gonna start a movement on this subreddit, we commonly refer to (the artist formerly known as) Victoria Coren Mitchell as VCM. Now that she is Ol' Goosebump Arm, I say that we shorten the name to OGA."
5,qwzq61_00006,"The episode's great as usual, especially of Alex being just the right amount of scary for the children going out on Halloween--Freddy Krueger could just nod in shame to that. For the goosebumps task, everyone went for the temperature aspect but Desiree (and me) had the idea of a light breeze/sensations. I didn't expect her to say blow down her neck that bluntly and me to have goosebumps at the thought of it! And while I'm on about goosebumps...may Old Goosebump Arms be a dear part of us all!--as a fun nickname at least. Bonus--Greg: Did she (Desiree) get some goosebumps? She did. Alex: Yeah, they weren't massively visible, but-- Desiree: I'm sorry my goosebumps aren't big enough to satisfy you but, you know, the pipe didn't really get me there Alex! (Hey-ho!)"
6,qwzq61_00007,"Great episode again with a great cast. I do have to say though, I - like Old Goosebumps Arm, truly cannot do ""prank calls"" or that kind of embarrassment/cringe humor. I had to skip past parts of it. It just makes me sweat. Fun ep though. Alex really seems to have more opportunity to crack his own jokes which I appreciate. OGA truly makes some.. odd decisions I'll never understand. Greg still seems to have a crush on Morgana (who can blame him). Alan had a wonderful breakdown again in the ""blindfold"" task, and nearly had a moment for the books in the live task! With the blindfold task, I'm a bit sad it didn't happen - but I strongly assume the purpose of ""throwing the paint"" was that Alex expect a contestant to get used to navigating backwards and then accidentally throw the paint away from the soldier while looking at him backwards, which I honestly think I might have done. Only negative thing I noticed is that the editing/pacing seemed a bit off this ep. Some very sudden cuts and what seemed like ""missing"" moments."
7,qwzq61_00008,Not a fan of studio team tasks. Especially when it's 5 to 0 and no one was disqualified.
8,qwzq61_00009,"Victoria literally CRINGING HERSELF INSIDE OUT with mortification over having to make a phone call. She is my spirit animal, I adore her."
9,qwzq61_00010,I love Alan just calling someone he hasn't seen in 6 years to yawn down the phone at her
10,qwzq61_00011,"‘He didn’t even get any GCSEs, how does he know what a harmonica is’ everything that Guz says is gold"
11,qwzq61_00012,Can’t believe it’s the last episode next week. I’m not ready to say goodbye to this cast.
12,qwzq61_00013,Victoria proving with the reference to VAR that she definitely knew what she was doing buying Alan the man u ticket
13,qwzq61_00014,The fact that Alan has been wearing an identical T-shirt to his hoodie is absolutely perfect.
14,qwzq61_00015,"Chaddan Davies: Phones someone after six years, Yawns for 10 seconds, Hangs up immediately, Leaves"
15,qwzq61_00016,Victoria being outraged that Greg threatened to disqualify Morgana 😭 I love the friendships this series.
16,qwzq61_00017,"If I had a penny for every time Morgana put ice in her jacket, I would have two pennies. Which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice."
17,qwzq61_00018,Going to lob a tennis ball at an old woman with osteoporosis now.
18,qwzq61_00019,"Victoria saying ""this is awful! this is awful"" was such a Mitchell thing"
19,qwzq61_00020,Was Alan wearing a dignity t-shirt underneath a dignity hoodie?
20,qwzq61_00021,ReleaseTheMorganaDomeCut
21,qwzq61_00022,I think this is the best set of tasks within a single episode taskmaster has had for a long while.
22,qwzq61_00023,I've never identified with anyone in this show as much as I did with Victoria when she had to call to someone.
23,qwzq61_00024,Guz volunteering himself to show off his tennis ball towel and then lobbing that ball is the energy I want from prize tasks
24,qwzq61_00025,SMASH IT DESIREE. Whoever she’s on the phone with is clearly just used to her being weird on the phone I guess.
25,qwzq61_00026,Surely the fact they called her Old Goosebump Arm multiple times in this episode means she should have gotten the points back?
26,qwzq61_00027,"The soldier has to be Tim Key, right?"
27,qwzq61_00028,"""Is it electric."" It's not a cattle prod, Guz. Lol"
28,qwzq61_00029,"I love Desiree, but her air horn is a distant second to Jessica Knappett's."
29,qwzq61_00030,I'd hate this task just like Victoria. I hate talking to people on the phone lol.
30,qwzq61_00031,Is anyone else in love with Morgana's studio look today? Love the green eyeshadow!
31,qwzq61_00032,"Alex's exclamation of ""Why am I the nan?"" cracked me up more than anything I've seen in a while and I can't really fathom why."
32,qwzq61_00033,I came to say to things. the conversation task is now one of my favourite tasks ever. Morgana…..va va va voom (respectfully)
33,qwzq61_00034,Just wanted to point out that Guz totally didn't bring 40 identical things.
34,qwzq61_00035,"“He didn’t even get any GCSEs and he knows what a harmonica is.” God, Guz has a way with words."
35,qwzq61_00036,Alex just playing out his fantasy of running fairground booths
36,qwzq61_00037,"Get Goosebumps - ""Type in powerful music."""
37,qwzq61_00038,"Loving the Wem towel, gives me 'Taskmaster gifts' vibes"
38,qwzq61_00039,Morgana reads the task Her First thought: stick something down her bra This subreddit: 😍
39,qwzq61_00040,Greg shading Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Socialist king ❤️
40,qwzq61_00041,I think even if Alex was coming at me with a chainsaw he could not physically instil fear.
41,qwzq61_00042,"Victoria getting 85% of the paint directly into the Soldiers exposed eyes, well done!"
42,qwzq61_00043,"Missing it by an inch, that was heartbreaking"
43,qwzq61_00044,Greg has such a big crush on Morganna and so do I
44,qwzq61_00045,victoria’s goosebumps task is the worst attempt of a task in recent memory but i want her to get points so #goosebumparms
45,qwzq61_00046,Alex’s romance pipe. That’s a euphemism I haven’t heard before.
46,qwzq61_00047,"I'm glad Alex pointed out the Goosebumps books in the caravan. There have been a couple tasks this season where I was wondering if they'd set something up that the contestants just didn't happen to find. Plus they recently released the video of Alex using bananas to stop bowling balls. Seeing clever alternative methods makes me even more impressed with the tasks, while in no way diminishing what the contestants did."
47,qwzq61_00048,Morgana looks stunning in the studio.
48,qwzq61_00049,"Greg, every single person wants to shag Morgana, so we don't blame you, but you just can't hand her five points when she reveals she cheated. Joe Wilkinson just threw his potato out the window. For the phone call, I would call my internet service provider and try to cancel my service. Presumably they would try to keep me on the line and convince me to stay no matter what nonsense I'd spew. I'd feel the same as Victoria, though. I hate making prank calls. For the goose bumps, my instinct is to see if they'll dump a bucket of ice on me while I'm blindfolded. Would the suspense help with goosebumps? Don't know if it would work."
49,qwzq61_00050,"Ah, Victoria and challenging authority"
50,qwzq61_00051,It was almost an Alan and Old Goosebump Arm victory 😭

56,qwzq61_00057,"I was thinking that VCM should have phoned David and it would have been the closest we get to seeing him being on TM. But then on the other hand, he’ll either catch on to it that it’s a task VCM is doing, or David will just not want to sustain such a long phone call."
57,qwzq61_00058,Also. How fucking gorgeous is Desiree looking in the studio this episode??
58,qwzq61_00059,"The phone task reminded me of the pizza task from series 2, that was a great one (I think they reused that for the US version?) And the goosebumps felt similar to the collecting tears/sweat in an eggcup, or sneezing in s5."
59,qwzq61_00060,I love Guz calling out Alex for his sadistic desire to see him walk into things.
60,qwzq61_00061,Greg from earlier series would have disqualified Morgana there.
61,qwzq61_00062,Alan's got a matching t-shirt just in case something like this happened! That's a strong effort.

63,qwzq61_00064,"Guz! The tennis balls hahahaha Also Ol' Goosebump Arm trying to make monster noises <3 And what a brilliant, suspenseful final task!"
64,qwzq61_00065,I realised last night that next week is the final and I’m absolutely gutted. This has been a belter of a series. I’ll be very sad to see this series end.
65,qwzq61_00066,Victoria gave herself smallpox
66,qwzq61_00067,Alex's Romance Pipe has made an appearance before.
67,qwzq61_00068,"Great tasks all the way through. Big fan of Ol' Goosebump Arm. Although it's extremely close, I'm predicting a Morgana win for the series."
68,qwzq61_00069,"Everyone is talking about Old Goosebump Arm, but no one is talking about Old Drippy Crack."
69,qwzq61_00070,Desiree mentioning a UTI isn’t even the most embarrassing thing about her conversation.
70,qwzq61_00071,the way Alex responded nothing matters made me enlightened
71,qwzq61_00072,"Desiree asking Alex to blow on her neck, Christ!!!!"
72,qwzq61_00073,Keeping track of the points as if Old Goosebump Arm had got her deserved 5 points
73,qwzq61_00074,"OldGooseBumpArms was robbed at the end, there."
74,qwzq61_00075,"This is the most cringeworthy task of the series, I think."
75,qwzq61_00076,Wasn't expecting Alex to say the title!
76,qwzq61_00077,Victoria has some great monster noises.
77,qwzq61_00078,I nearly screamed when I thought Morgana was gonna get disqualified lmaooooo.. Victoria’s lil noo was cute
78,qwzq61_00079,This task is like some doctor who episode
79,qwzq61_00080,I thought Victoria had a good argument on why her goosebumps should’ve counted as goosebumps.
80,qwzq61_00081,Where was the footage of Morgana and the dome?!?! This subreddit needs it for research
81,qwzq61_00082,"Great tasks all episode, great episode. Big time for Alan's dignity t shirt. Though it's a shame that the task being a 5 or 0 task means that it's no longer extraordinarily tight going into the last episode"
82,qwzq61_00083,I think it should have been 42 things on a towel in homage to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
83,qwzq61_00084,"""You're not blindfolded, you can see."" I nearly spit when. I'm heard Alex say that."
84,qwzq61_00085,Was the guy in the ghillie suit Tim Key?
85,qwzq61_00086,Old Goosebump Arm deserves to win this task
86,qwzq61_00087,Some comeback from Morgana in this episode
87,qwzq61_00088,That live task was fantastic
88,qwzq61_00089,"Brilliant episode, possibly best this series (so far...)"
89,qwzq61_00090,"Desiree was one of the only two people who got goosebumps in the get goosebumps task, and came third."
90,qwzq61_00091,This task has broken Victoria completely. 🤣
91,qwzq61_00092,
92,qwzq61_00093,I enjoy Old Goosebump Arm's TV appearances (point incoming)
93,qwzq61_00094,"Look like Morgana's the likely to win the series. Guz could take it next episode, and maybe Alan has a small chance if they do badly enough and he does well enough next episode, but it's no longer as close as it was last week."
94,qwzq61_00095,Some of the best tasks all season on this ep!
95,qwzq61_00096,I'd definitely feel like Victoria doing this phone task
96,qwzq61_00097,"Desiree so good at this task, she and her friend clearly just chat shit at each other all day even when not being commanded by the Taskmaster."
97,qwzq61_00098,I kinda hope old goosebump arm wins
98,qwzq61_00099,"Victoria has been incredibly unlucky in the live tasks the whole series. But oh my god the tension, when it was Alan's last turn - so entertaining. I'm gonna miss this cast very much, they are all so lovely."
99,qwzq61_00100,"Quick everyone, get Old Goosebump Arm those retroactive points."
100,qwzq61_00101,Anyone else been trying to give themselves goosebumps for the past few minutes?
101,qwzq61_00102,"Maybe it's cause I just rewatched the movies (again) but I get goosebumbs in 'The Return of the King"" when Aragorn tells the hobbits ""My friends, you bow to no one"". Aaand yep, goosebumps again just typing it. Simple, immediate. No ice needed."
102,qwzq61_00103,It’s leaking in my ..… crack The way Guz said it just set me off laughing
103,qwzq61_00104,I'm going to say this again: I would hate doing this task. I try to avoid calling people for a reason. I guess at least you can call someone you know - I thought you'd be calling some stranger - but that wouldn't help much.
104,qwzq61_00105,I can actually feel my socially anxious heart racing at this task.
105,qwzq61_00106,It's amazing when you consider we've gone from eat the most watermelon to this
106,qwzq61_00107,"Victoria ""Old Goosebump Arm"" Coren Mitchell"
107,qwzq61_00108,I need a Morgana calendar that includes a picture of her stood for that prize task. Best look of the series so far
108,qwzq61_00109,"On the live task, they were all wearing plastic gloves (for obvious reasons) but several of them repeatedly touched their faces, completely defeating the purpose."
109,qwzq61_00110,Never have I been so confident I could nail a task as much as the goosebumps one. So easy.
110,qwzq61_00111,Greg blaming Alex. You love to see it
111,qwzq61_00112,Alex making Desiree moist??
112,qwzq61_00113,A 5-point lead going into the final episode? Doesn't seem easily surmountable
113,qwzq61_00114,The find the soldier task is actually a repeat of a task from Bäst i Test season 4! I love that we've come full circle and the original is now using tasks from versions it spawned.
114,qwzq61_00115,I would be Victoria with this task...MY NIGHTMARE
115,qwzq61_00116,"Morgana acting out my first thought for this task, nice! Just RUN GET COLD GO"
116,qwzq61_00117,"Wow, what a great selection of tasks! Brilliant episode"
117,qwzq61_00118,Am I right in thinking from the voice that Victoria called David Baddiel?
118,qwzq61_00119,I like all the people agreeing that actually physically calling someone on the phone for as long as possible would be a terrible experience.
119,qwzq61_00120,"Throwing shade at Amazon, we love to see it"
120,qwzq61_00121,Fair play morgana Edit: eh oh no
121,qwzq61_00122,Can we now give 5 points to Joe Wilkinson for the potato
122,qwzq61_00123,"""Wise old sages."" Victoria took exception to that."
123,qwzq61_00124,Old goosebump arms needs that point
124,qwzq61_00125,Shame Old Goosebump Arm didn't get any points.
125,qwzq61_00126,my take on Morgana being singled out for the throwing paint task was that she would throw it on the walkie talkie oh how wrong i was
126,qwzq61_00127,It’s leaking in my… CRACK! HA!
127,qwzq61_00128,He didn’t even get any GCSEs and he knows what a harmonica is!
128,qwzq61_00129,"YES, THE TRADITIONAL WAY"
129,qwzq61_00130,"Victoria’s continued outrage at being called old and Alex persisting in calling her old. Rude, Alex, rude!"
130,qwzq61_00131,Alan has the same design on his t-shirt! Love that
131,qwzq61_00132,"Like Alan, I laugh when I’m nervous. Can confirm, leads to very awkward situations."
132,qwzq61_00133,"I know it's not about the points, but it's been a while since we had a close gap before the finale, this episode started with the hope it would happen but then ended it!"
133,qwzq61_00134,It’s the penultimate episode I can’t believe it
134,qwzq61_00135,I'd like to hang out with Desiree and Dave
135,qwzq61_00136,Gotta love ol' Goosebump arms! Can't wait to see her on onlyconnect
136,qwzq61_00137,Morgana is giving pure mommy vibes I need her outfit and general looks
137,qwzq61_00138,"Should have called a telephone centre for your phone call. You may be in the waiting queue on hold, but it is a call."
138,qwzq61_00139,Finally. The goosebump task is one I would crush.
139,qwzq61_00140,Victoria actually did pretty well I thought
140,qwzq61_00141,Oh Victoria. That would be my nightmare too

142,qwzq61_00143,"I love this series, definitely one of the best vibes between contestants combined with good tasks. Love it."

144,qwzq61_00145,'Nothing matters' 😂
145,qwzq61_00146,Let's get old goosebump arms her points!
146,qwzq61_00147,For the goosebumps I would have watched one of those epic music videos from YouTube. Anyone else get goosebumps from epic music or movie trailers etc? I think that would have been my best bet but under pressure I don't know how that would work
147,qwzq61_00148,I genuinely feel bad for Alan
148,qwzq61_00149,Respect dave
149,qwzq61_00150,It is eyes at the back of your head time. Eyes at the back of your head o' clock.

152,qwzq61_00153,Is joe Wilkinson the soldier?
153,qwzq61_00154,Victoria is so embarrassed I love it
154,qwzq61_00155,Anyone else yawning their head off now?
155,qwzq61_00156,"Oh, Alan 😭😭😭"
156,qwzq61_00157,Obsessed with Alan's t-shirt matching his hoodie. That's commitment.
157,qwzq61_00158,THAT WAS TENSE.
158,qwzq61_00159,Rarely laughed so much watching a task. This is awesome!
159,qwzq61_00160,I'm loving this task! I feel like Morgana is going to be really good at it
160,qwzq61_00161,Morgana just doing the task and not fucking around. That's how we love her!
161,qwzq61_00162,Morgana bosses that
162,qwzq61_00163,I think anyone else would have been disqualified for that.
163,qwzq61_00164,He's even got a dignity shirt! Wonderful!
164,qwzq61_00165,Alex's nihilism seeping out there
165,qwzq61_00166,Omg the drama!
166,qwzq61_00167,"Great episode today! Loved all the tasks, great studio finish!"
167,qwzq61_00168,I can give myself goosebumps instantly by brushing my hand gently on my abdomen/back. I would have done that task in seconds. Is it not that common?
168,qwzq61_00169,Chips are dope man!
169,qwzq61_00170,
170,qwzq61_00171,I would love to have a go at this
171,qwzq61_00172,Alan getting chicken legs and presenting them as goosebumps 😭
172,qwzq61_00173,How is Desiree so good at this?!
173,qwzq61_00174,Guz's face when this task is announced.
174,qwzq61_00175,Is that Joe Wilkinson in the ghilli suit?
175,qwzq61_00176,Why not walk backwards?
176,qwzq61_00177,LAH - the least scary man alive
177,qwzq61_00178,DRAMA
178,qwzq61_00179,I got goosebumps within 0.25 seconds of the contestants starting the goosebump task.
179,qwzq61_00180,God damn it was so close!
180,qwzq61_00181,"Desiree bringing trophies and coins should have been disallowed, wasn't the task bring 40 of one thing that would all fit on a tea towel?"
181,qwzq61_00182,I get goosebumps from sneezing or after I make a number 2. Or when I listen to someone singing a song for a singing completion audition. I would’ve dominated the task.
182,qwzq61_00183,What an amazing task
183,qwzq61_00184,I love it when one of them makes a sad little face as a task is announced
184,qwzq61_00185,Where are the cloisters that they film some of the tasks in?
185,qwzq61_00186,Haha guz
186,qwzq61_00187,"You could just buy a goosebumps book as an ebook, would be done in seconds"
187,qwzq61_00188,"For the goosebumps one, I’d be finding a chalkboard to scratch my nails against, or a dinner plate to scratch a fork or knife against"
188,qwzq61_00189,"Lol right as Greg says ""it's little"" (Alex Horne) the editors flip up his hair hahah"
189,qwzq61_00190,Victoria really liked the idea of a death phone call.
190,qwzq61_00191,
191,qwzq61_00192,That soldier sounds like Joe Wilkinson? A bit? Hmm now it sounds like Alex on a recording
192,qwzq61_00193,I'd love to know where this is filmed
193,qwzq61_00194,Boo.
194,qwzq61_00195,Just find some music!
195,qwzq61_00196,My first instinct for goosebumps was to listen to some really profound music.. Hollie Steel from BGT maybe?
196,qwzq61_00197,Haha alan
197,qwzq61_00198,This looks fun
198,qwzq61_00199,
199,qwzq61_00200,Ducks!!
200,qwzq61_00201,"I'm not sure if I'm being dumb, but I've not seen the overall series scores for a while. Who's in front at the moment? I would think Guz Khan is leading."
201,qwzq61_00202,"Could you phone someone during the 2 minutes before the task starts properly, and warn them?"
202,qwzq61_00203,"I am not sure what it is about this program, but the lesser know comedians always come across as brilliant. I guess rather then seeing their onstage persona making jokes they are being themselves somewhat."
203,qwzq61_00204,Boom!
204,qwzq61_00205,Alan 😂
205,qwzq61_00206,
206,qwzq61_00207,Greg predicted the future with that one!

4,r25plb_00005,
5,r25plb_00006,So Morgana won the series because she called Alex a little fuck? 😅
6,r25plb_00007,"I absolutely love Morgana but I'm gutted Guz didn't win. This is mainly because she cheated and got away with it. I know it was Alex's job to check but she obviously knew she wasn't meant to see but cheated anyway. As great as she is as a contestant, she didn't deserve to win in my opinion."
7,r25plb_00008,"Morgana won thanks to the ""little fucker"" bonus point"
8,r25plb_00009,Alan's monster noise just put me on the floor laughing. Oh my lord haha
9,r25plb_00010,This is the perfect task as the last task of this series AND as a covid task! A studio audience would've given it all away!
10,r25plb_00011,"'In a way, we didn't need Guz' 😂"
11,r25plb_00012,"Loved the stage task so much, easily one of the best tasks of the show."
12,r25plb_00013,Alan looked as surprised as everyone else that that noise came out of him!

16,r25plb_00017,"I'm really glad we'll see Morgana in CoC3, but gutted about Guz losing"
17,r25plb_00018,THE BONUS POINT FROM THE VERY FIRST TASK I CANNOT BELIEVE IT
18,r25plb_00019,It's always fun when they have a two person team task and have to find something for the third to do.
19,r25plb_00020,This has been the only thing missing from Greg’s throne. The ability to spin around. How fucking cool did Greg look?
20,r25plb_00021,guz's alex impression kills me every time
21,r25plb_00022,"Morgana actually a Marionette in human form, like Mike Wozniak, her body was making weird angles that are not generally found within the normal range of human movement"
22,r25plb_00023,"Downing pints like a champ, no gag reflex and an alibi for murder? This episode is not helping with my crush on Desiree."
23,r25plb_00024,It just had to be the little fucker point that won it! What a series!
24,r25plb_00025,I hope this win opens up more doors for Morgana. I'm thinking probably Nobel Prize next.
25,r25plb_00026,The best arc of this season is Morgana winning by one point from Guz because she called Alex a little fucker in episode 1.
26,r25plb_00027,"I had tears twice in this episode. The first was when Victoria said she was so besotted with David that she worried about proposing even just for a task, what a beautiful marriage. The second was at Alan’s “WOOOOOOW’"
27,r25plb_00028,The final live task was way funnier than it should had been by the description.
28,r25plb_00029,Morgana gifs about to make this sub explode.
29,r25plb_00030,I LOVE it when Alex loses his composure and giggles behind his clipboard
30,r25plb_00031,When Desiree proved that the drinking task wasn’t impossible and did it in 7 seconds I felt more pride in her as a fellow American than I have ever had watching someone win the Olympics
31,r25plb_00032,Holy fuck I’ve just stopped crying with laughter at the “wow monster”. Moment of the series for me.
32,r25plb_00033,"JESUS FUCK. GUZ, I AM TERRIFIED. But I would also say yes."
33,r25plb_00034,"Series 12 is definitely one of the best series of Taskmaster, I'm so sad it's over. I'm looking forward to them getting back in front of an audience and the added energy from that though! And I'm grateful they do 2 seasons a year (plus we have CoC and NYT to look forward to)."
34,r25plb_00035,I know it's been said throughout the series but Guz had very strong little boy energy in the team task right down to the fact that he was supposed to eat 1 chocolate button and ended up eating more than 30.
35,r25plb_00036,"I knew that extra point Greg gave Morgana for calling Alex a fucker episode 1 was going to come in play, I just didn't know it was going literally be the winning point."
36,r25plb_00037,
37,r25plb_00038,Iain Stirling is raging somewhere right now.
38,r25plb_00039,Victoria flipping birds at Greg is just the ultimate.
39,r25plb_00040,That final live task was the hardest I’ve laughed since Jessica Knappet fell off the stage.
40,r25plb_00041,OH VICTORIA. HER LOVE FOR DAVID IS SO PURE 😭
41,r25plb_00042,I have tears in my eyes from Alans monster.
42,r25plb_00043,David is such a lucky man omg
43,r25plb_00044,Guz just straight vibing while Desiree and Morgana have full breakdowns right there.
44,r25plb_00045,guz and alex already have the demeanor of a married couple tbf
45,r25plb_00046,I’m devastated this series is over. Easily one of my top three series.
46,r25plb_00047,This is not good for Victoria's dignity. What little was left.
47,r25plb_00048,"If I had a nickel for everytime someone brought a doll of themselves with a penis, I would have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it has happened twice."
48,r25plb_00049,Happy for Morgana she was ace. Embodied and embraced the show fully from episode one. What a great cast though it’s the only series I genuinely would have been fine with anyone winning.
49,r25plb_00050,Morgana won with the little fucker bonus!
50,r25plb_00051,"Seeing Morgana completely lose it in the background after each noise killed me! And, that face Alex made after Alan's beatboxing. I didn't think his face could do that."
51,r25plb_00052,Victoria and David are so cute im getting a cavity
52,r25plb_00053,"One of the funniest things to me is that Guzzy Bear farted his way to 2nd putting in nearly no effort. The only thing more hilarious would have been him winning it. Morgana is a well-deserved champ though -- I think she is one of the greatest Taskmaster contestants ever. Just this chaotic ball of fuckery. Can't wait to see her on a future Champion of Champions. I only vaguely knew of Morgana before this, but I am a massive fan of her now. What an amazing cast -- Alan was so adorably ... well, old. Victoria was the people's champion. Desiree was a fucking sonic boom tearing her way through -- in any other season, I think she would have probably won it. Honestly, despite some of the tasks being IMO so-so, the cast has made this one of if not THE best series. I didn't care who won - I don't know how the next cast can beat this one. I mean, I always feel this way when a season ends, but this time more than ever. You could just see how much these gals and guys just loved being in each other's company."
53,r25plb_00054,"Victoria is so sweet. Honestly, you can tell how much she’s in love with David, aw."
54,r25plb_00055,Either I’m a freak of nature or these people are overthinking it because I just tried this with a glass of water and found it very easy lol Update: I just filmed myself doing it as proof because my mam thinks it isn’t possible lmao
55,r25plb_00056,This series has hands down had my favourite live tasks in TM history.
56,r25plb_00057,"can we get guz to yell ""I AM NOT A CROOK"" too"
57,r25plb_00058,"Star Wars: Episode 10 ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Everyone has tiny penises"""
58,r25plb_00059,its incredible that Desiree demonstrated her lack of gag reflex in the same episode she declared it
59,r25plb_00060,"Shout out to Morgana and Desirée's outfits representing night and day. Also I was with Alex on ""What I think you're hoping is that you don't go first. What I'm hoping is that you do."" Considering what we learnt about Victoria, not knowing what beatboxing is was kind of on brand, but still surprising."
60,r25plb_00061,"Top tier cast tbf, close to the end and everyone having a laugh and being supportive throughout."
61,r25plb_00062,this has been the best series for live tasks
62,r25plb_00063,"Kind of disappointed that no-one thought to say ""boots 'n' cats"" for the beatboxing part."
63,r25plb_00064,"""Have you proposed to anypne before, Victoria?"" All I can think of is David's telling of his proposal to her, and how her answer was ""of course."" Such a great couple."
64,r25plb_00065,"If Victoria proposed to me, I would break up with my boyfriend immediately."
65,r25plb_00066,That live task is going my top 5 ever. Those two noises at the end...
66,r25plb_00067,
67,r25plb_00068,"the one Victoria guess was in fact a pretty big compliment. Greg knew that she was smart enough to pull a sudden move like being a completely voiceless monster. I'm inclined to think Alan was actively trying to sound like Guz when beatboxing. I legit got a headache from laughing so hard at Alan's monster. In the proposal task initially I was actually kinda turned off at Victoria's response, but holy hell did she manage to win me over about it in the end. it still blows my mind she was one of the most isolated lasts of the entire history."
68,r25plb_00069,"It made me smile so much that Victoria is so in love with David that it made her uncomfortable to even pretend to propose to Alex. Maybe it also stems from the fact that she thought it was a chuppah instead of a mere decoration wedding arch, and chuppah weddings are Serious Business before God"
69,r25plb_00070,This is like a much better version of The Voice
70,r25plb_00071,Guz coming 2nd by one point 🥲 Absolutely love Morgana though so I’m still happy
71,r25plb_00072,I knew she'd makeout with the head!! 😂😂
72,r25plb_00073,"Ohhh, Desirees' metallic rainbow dress is a thing of wonder and beauty! (Everyone else looking very fine and dandy too)"
73,r25plb_00074,"God, going to miss all five of these weirdos so fucking much."
74,r25plb_00075,"I loved Morgana, but I low-key think Guz was robbed."
75,r25plb_00076,"There was true joy in all the contestants, Greg and Alex during the final task. Everyone was laughing so hard that they couldn't keep it together. Add in the silent outrage when they were caught or the glee in their eyes when they were mistaken for someone else. Phenomenal final task. Whole series has been gangbusters. And I feel like I'll watch anything with Morgana, Desiree or Guz Khan in it (didn't know them very well before this). My view of Alan Davies as the QI goofball has been transformed into the taskmaster sweetie. I'm even more proud of my Victoria Coren Mitchell tattoo than I ever have been. Honestly, I just want to see the video of the wrap party."
76,r25plb_00077,"Absolutely smashing series and I love that any of the four could have won it in this episode. I think this was my all time favourite cast, comedy-wise everyone held their own and could laugh at themselves and also were really different to each other in a very complementary way. I am really looking forward to seeing Morgana, Guz and Desiree in more panel shows (hopefully). I also loved seeing very different sides to both Alan and Victoria than I was expecting. The only thing I would have changed is how the teams were put together. I felt the dynamics fell a bit flat with the predictable young vs old divide. I would have loved to see Victoria and Desiree in the same team with Desiree understanding Victoria's eccentric nerd side a bit better than Alan, and Alan and Morgana interacting more as they had a really great chemistry imo."
77,r25plb_00078,"Aw man, I always get so depressed at these Taskmaster finales because it's all over. But that final live task was the absolute hardest I've laughed in a long time. Just watching Morgana reacting in the background to all the ridiculous attempts (Alan's were consistently hilarious) was worth the price of admission. Alan's ""WoOoW"" monster took the cake at the end. I'm really going to miss this cast's antics. The drink with your mouth open task was simple, classic Taskmaster perfection. The proposal to Alex was one of my favorites, but I'm really disappointed that Alex didn't get to score the outcome to that task. Instead of having two people tied at 5 points, there should have been one definitive acceptance to the proposal. Anyway, that Morgana siren was definitely irresistible to me. A worthy inheritor of the Greg bust. Looking forward at the lineup for series 13, I'm only familiar with Chris Ramsey and Judi Love (not a fan of the latter). But as always, I'm prepared for a cracking good time."
78,r25plb_00079,Morgana was given a rare extra point for calling Alex a little fucker. That's the winning point. They talk about Desiree having been a dominatrix in the past. Didn't think a task would be won with those talents. Too funny.
79,r25plb_00080,I’m gutted this series has finished. I adored series 10 and 11 but the end of this series is making me as sad as when series 9 came to an end. I’ve loved every episode. I loved the teams and the contestants individually. I’ve absolutely howled every week. Victoria has been an absolute ball. She’s adorable and hilarious and I love her. I absolutely have a crush on all the contestants because they’ve all been bloody brilliant. And I’m sad we won’t see them again. What a fantastic series.
80,r25plb_00081,"I was rooting for Guz from the start but, honestly, any of them could have won and I would have been happy - Morgana definitely deserved it, she tried so hard at everything"
81,r25plb_00082,This series has definitely just flown by. How is it already 10 weeks?
82,r25plb_00083,Am I in the minority for loving this season? I’ve seen a lot of people saying it’s one of the worst but man I loved the cast
83,r25plb_00084,"What a great little series this one was. Series 10 had some hurdles and Series 11 was mostly there, but this one really just felt so tight and good all throughout. Very comfy, which reminds me of the earlier series. I've said it before, but while watching Taskmaster I often think of the episode in terms of ""Would I show this one to someone as the first episode of Taskmaster they ever watch?"" and with this series I think.. almost every episode is a yes. Have to give some real props to Alan for constantly being on the ball with new tasks and such, especially as limitations come and go. I know Series 11, despite being quite good - still had a decent handful of tasks that.. just wernt that great I felt. But series 12 has almost no duds, with great live tasks especially. I'll miss this group! As for this episode in particular, not too much to say. I think the Finale's always have Alex having a little more ""out of character"" reactions which I appreciate. Morgana's proposal was.. quite something. If her and Greg start dating irl you heard it here first. Alan's scream was so good, just out of no where. And that drinking with your mouth open task? So simple and deceptively hard."
84,r25plb_00085,"A smashing final episode and congratulations to Morgana! If there is a ""all's well that end's well"" moment from each of them... Gus: Having a bowl of chocolate dots while relaxing Alan: ""Woooooaaaaaauuuuuu!"" Desiree: Proposing to Alex to make her ""the happiest weirdo"" Morgana: Singing her siren song in the tub Victoria: Setting her two birds free and never looking back Bonus--Greg: It's pretty damn sweet if you asked me, and just shows the lack of regard that the other people here have for their partners. Gus: Nah-nah, don't say that! I love you! Relax, bruv, it's a game show."
85,r25plb_00086,The fringe of Claudia Winkleman better not be the closest we get to Actual Claudia Winkleman ever coming on this show. Even a New Years' Special. I just want her to terrify Alex with her boundless energy.
86,r25plb_00087,I'm definitely gonna need a gif of Victoria flipping Greg off
87,r25plb_00088,God I have such a huge crush on Victoria. My little lesbian heart is aflutter.
88,r25plb_00089,WoooooaOW!
89,r25plb_00090,The little fucker point!
90,r25plb_00091,"Man, all 3 of these lockdown series have been fantastic. Everyone's got their own charm, but something about Alan constantly cracking himself up made me laugh as much as anyone else."
91,r25plb_00092,"Don't get me wrong, Morgana was great but I'm kinda gutted Guz didn't win. Especially as it was one point and it feels like Morgana was given about 5 bonus points throughout the series"
92,r25plb_00093,"This was absolutely one of the best seasons ever, we need more nerds in the cast like richard osman and victoria."
93,r25plb_00094,Desiree has experience downing pints I see
94,r25plb_00095,Alan got him to sign the 'nup. That's closer than any of the others got.
95,r25plb_00096,Father Dougal!
96,r25plb_00097,"Was a great season, and it sealed off with a truly great task. So much to unpack in that final task, Alan Davis horrible monster sound, Morgana doing a shitty beatbox on purpose and Greg immediately realizing she is the only one devious enough to do so, and also Greg knowing Victoria is the most likely to be a smartass and do the stomping sounds. Probably some more I'm forgetting. So many great moments in one task."
97,r25plb_00098,"As an Australian woman, I feel extremely proud that two Australian women have won Taskmaster UK."
98,r25plb_00099,A truly amazing finale to an amazing series. I loved Desiree’s playful glare at VCG when she walked behind her during the live task 😂. I wish it had been 20eps
99,r25plb_00100,"As a former gifted and talented student who is now flopping in life, I relate to Victoria’s breakdown."
100,r25plb_00101,Guz noshing down 36 chocolate buttons is honestly such a vibe
101,r25plb_00102,Rigged. Everything Morgana does is irresistible.
102,r25plb_00103,This is easily one of my favourite stage tasks
103,r25plb_00104,"Gotta say, I'm really gonna miss this cast. By far the strongest of the COVID casts, in my opinion, and one of the strongest overall. There wasn't really a weak link. Towards the end I was like ""oh man, who do I even want to win? I love them all"". This has been up there with series 5 and 7."
104,r25plb_00105,The editing (and music) on this show is so incredible. The intercutting of Guz eating chocolate buttons and Morgana miming is hilarious
105,r25plb_00106,"I would marry Desiree after that proposal, ngl. The promise of no gag reflex and an alibi for murder 😍😍😍"
106,r25plb_00107,Boots and cats and boots and cats!! IAIN We remember you!
107,r25plb_00108,Can’t believe they’ve let Dougal do a Taskmaster
108,r25plb_00109,"I know this isn’t quite in the spirit of the prize task, but I imagine Greedy Esq. is made out of felt and therefore a bit floppy. Not as floppy as Alan’s voodoo genitals though."
109,r25plb_00110,I’m retrospectively kinda mad about that bonus point!
110,r25plb_00111,"From episode one in like the first task I thought to myself ""Morgana understands the game and has the winner energy"" and she sure did. I'm ready for her to face off against Sarah one day. Loved everyone on this series! Excellent balances of energy."
111,r25plb_00112,"Desiree, you had me at gag reflex."
112,r25plb_00113,I’M IN TEARS.
113,r25plb_00114,"""I want to weep."" Me too Victoria. Me too."
114,r25plb_00115,Did you know the sound that Alan made in the final task is actually the sound of a blue whale? (Not really tho but it would be neat wouldn’t it?)
115,r25plb_00116,"What a fantastic season. I think it was one of the strongest seasons by far, with every task so well written, some reminiscent of the older seasons' simpler tasks. Every episode had a banger of a task in it, and all the studio tasks were on point. The last studio task was absolutely hilarious, I went breathless with just the anticipation of what Alan was about to come up with. Absolutely golden. I'm gonna miss this cast."
116,r25plb_00117,The last task made me cry!!! it was hilarious. I loved this season
117,r25plb_00118,"Honestly don't understand how there are so many negtive comments over the new contestants. Just because you didn't like how a person appeared on a different show doesn't mean you won't like them on this one. We all know that people are a lot different in tasks, it's high pressure and people all deal with that differently. Save your judgements until the series actually airs 🤷‍♀️"
118,r25plb_00119,"Oh, there is going to be so much whining about Morgana's bonus point, isn't there. Great episode! One of the best of the show."
119,r25plb_00120,I haven't laughed harder than during Guz's monster attempt.
120,r25plb_00121,"Petition to get a ""Wow Monster"" flair"
121,r25plb_00122,"Is nobody going to mention that Alan Davies, an Arsenal fan (especially during the Wenger years), came fourth?"
122,r25plb_00123,"What an episode what a Finale what a series. I loved how close everyone, except Victoria, were points wise. Never expected Alan to keep up this well."
123,r25plb_00124,This drinking task feels like yet another one of Alex’s fetishes that he’s broadcasting on air.
124,r25plb_00125,"Aw, she has such a great marriage that she worried about even fake proposing for a comedy show."
125,r25plb_00126,Greg laughing when he got them all right. Genuine malicious laughter.
126,r25plb_00127,Nooooo outsmarted by Greg predicting her own smartness.
127,r25plb_00128,"Father Dougal McGuire!! So unexpected, can't wait to see him."
128,r25plb_00129,"It is the general consensus so merely repeating it seems useless, but I can’t stop myself. This series was so great, this cast got on so well and built on each other’s personalities so beautifully, I’d be happy to see the lineup repeated for the rest of Taskmaster’s run. This truly was a magical series of television. Bravo to the cast and to the team at Taskmaster."
129,r25plb_00130,"""I have fancied you since you were born."""
130,r25plb_00131,"GUZ! His proposal attempt was INCREDIBLE. Such a plot twist! Also, awww Victoria <3 HAHA DOUBLE FINGERED SALUTE FROM VICTORIA IN THE FINAL TASK (She outsmarted herself though, sad) Victoria comes in 1st place for the most times placed last (7) and 2nd place for the most times placed last by proportion (after Nish with 75%)! Man, this series was awesome. This definitely stands above S10 and 11, maybe not above 7/9 but I think time will have us looking back on it as a solidly upper-tier season. I LOVE THEM ALL, and this is probably my favourite cast, even above S4!"
131,r25plb_00132,"Great overall episode, one of the better live tasks of the show. I can't believe Greg allowed drinking through a straw as ""drinking with your mouth open"" though, seems like just drinking normally would have qualified as well by that logic."
132,r25plb_00133,"Of all the circumstances I would’ve expected to hear the phrase “caring Uncle Minpict”, that was not one of them, but oh my god I laughed so much at that"
133,r25plb_00134,
134,r25plb_00135,"The problem most of them had with the drinking task is they just tried to pour it in. Put the mouth of the glass against your lower lip (which pushes it down a bit) and it becomes a whole lot easier! I demonstrated this to my co-watchers during the task, while complaining that they weren't even thinking about it. Then along came Desiree, and there you go!"
135,r25plb_00136,That ad reminds me that Ellie Taylor should really be on taskmaster at some point
136,r25plb_00137,"They're all just having so much fucking fun, dammit I'm going to miss this cast"
137,r25plb_00138,Brilliant final task. So funny.
138,r25plb_00139,Been hoping for Sophie Duker since she became a regular feature on Frankie Boyle’s New World Order!
139,r25plb_00140,"lmao greg's face when alex said morgana was spelling ""flirty and a little sexy,"" pure delight"
140,r25plb_00141,"While I was really hoping for a Guz win, Morgana deserves it the most, even though there was only 1 point in it at the end. This was a great finale and a great episode all round"
141,r25plb_00142,"I feel like the beatboxing one, though absolutely hilarious and an amazing idea, was always going to result in Greg guessing who it was. Alan and Victoria are, and I say this as a white man, exceptionally white. I think the only way someone could have gotten away with it is if they'd done a successful deception, e.g. what Morgana tried but Greg cleverly saw past."
142,r25plb_00143,Dougal's doing a funeral!? going on Taskmaster!?
143,r25plb_00144,David is going to be quite pleased with the tape of that task
144,r25plb_00145,The little fucker point!!! Fucking hell.
145,r25plb_00146,Thoroughly enjoyed this series. They've really knocked it out the park with the live tasks this series - I was crying laughing tonight!
146,r25plb_00147,I really loved this season. All the contestants were so great and funny. I genuinely would have been happy for any of them to win. I don't really know anyone in the next season (I'm not British). A couple look vaguely familiar so I imagine I've seen them on a panel show once or twice. It will be interesting because I think it's the first season where I haven't known at least one contestant. It won't effect the enjoyment though I'm sure. Some of my favourite contestants have been people I'd never heard of until Taskmaster.
147,r25plb_00148,Anyone got a gif of Desiree's silent FUUUU after her birdsong noise?
148,r25plb_00149,
149,r25plb_00150,Desiree’s dress is so pretty!
150,r25plb_00151,I hope Guz Khan knows that I would die for him.
151,r25plb_00152,Laughed more in this episode than most of the rest of the series (which I have absolutely loved) but this is just brilliant
152,r25plb_00153,I also knew a Chuppah was a wedding arch in Judaism because I watch a lot of Gilmore Girls.
153,r25plb_00154,OH. THIS IS LIKE THE TAKE PAUL ON A DATE TASK. MAYBE MY FAVOURITE TMNZ SERIES TWO TASK.
154,r25plb_00155,REVOLVE ME
155,r25plb_00156,This is an unexpectedly great live task
156,r25plb_00157,my boy Ardal what a win
157,r25plb_00158,"what a damn good series. Great cast, great tasks. I love how wholesome it feels too. Definitely worth a rewatch."
158,r25plb_00159,That live task was hilarious lmfao
159,r25plb_00160,Not sure if it's just the tasks but this episode has been incredibly well edited.
160,r25plb_00161,"Careful Alex, your kinks are showing"
161,r25plb_00162,Oh my god. Alex wasn't expecting a horse head.
162,r25plb_00163,"In the coming weeks, I expect this subreddit to be flooded with dozens of memes from that live task alone."
163,r25plb_00164,Well I think i know what will be this episode's most gif'ed moment...
164,r25plb_00165,morgana could make a calendar with those letters
165,r25plb_00166,oh victoria.
166,r25plb_00167,"“Put the sailor outfit on.” Oh, this gon be good."
167,r25plb_00168,AHHHH SOPHIE DUKER. I LOVE HER.
168,r25plb_00169,Don’t think I’ve ever been more excited for a contestant than I am for Bridget Christie!!!
169,r25plb_00170,This season definitely had the best studio tasks.
170,r25plb_00171,Does anyone feel the drinking task would be trivial? I wouldn't have had ANY issue with that at all.
171,r25plb_00172,Why did Alex look so adorable in the little sailor outfit? I can't wait for the GIFs.
172,r25plb_00173,Scenes if the next series lineup has Al Murray
173,r25plb_00174,Desiree smashed it.
174,r25plb_00175,Relax bruv it's a gameshow
175,r25plb_00176,"My TV just messed up, and it's switched to a mighty boosh episode instead."
176,r25plb_00177,"Genuinely astonishing amount of work on Morganas' part for that proposal, you have to admire her work ethic."
177,r25plb_00178,"When Morgana does something she does it 10,000%"
178,r25plb_00179,boots n' cats
179,r25plb_00180,Victoria's beatboxing attempt was delightful.
180,r25plb_00181,Alan got Greg crying.
181,r25plb_00182,MORGANA 🎉🎉 🎉
182,r25plb_00183,Ardal O’Hanlon! He’ll be great!
183,r25plb_00184,What a fantastic live task to end off a truly wonderful series - everyone surpassed my expectations for them and I know I’m the only one to fall head over heels for Morgana!
184,r25plb_00185,This has been one of my favourite episodes and one of my favourite series. I'm genuinely sad now.
185,r25plb_00186,VCM trying to waterboard herself.
186,r25plb_00187,How is having a straw in your mouth different from having the glass in your mouth???
187,r25plb_00188,The return of the Vegas Nixon chair
188,r25plb_00189,"I find Greg a tiny bit sexy, too."
189,r25plb_00190,"oh god, they've brought out the baddiel old people music"
190,r25plb_00191,"IT’S A YES, MORGANA. YOU DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO ASK. YOU CAN GIVE ME CRABS I DON’T EVEN CARE."
191,r25plb_00192,What the fuck was that lmao
192,r25plb_00193,This live task is in my top ten already
193,r25plb_00194,"Wow, looks like next series is gonna be the first ever series in which I (a non-Brit) don't know any of the contestants. That's kind of disappointing, ngl."
194,r25plb_00195,CHECKING IN FOR GUZ SHITHOUSERY
195,r25plb_00196,You just knew that whoever was last would smash it.
196,r25plb_00197,YES DESIREE. I’M SO TURNED ON RIGHT NOW.
197,r25plb_00198,Why is there a random catapult in the garden
198,r25plb_00199,Scores before live task VCM: 118 Guz: 162 Morgana: 163 Alan: 158 Desiree: 158
199,r25plb_00200,"Haha, Greg had Morgana’s number for the beatboxing"
200,r25plb_00201,Alan has been brilliant in this task.
201,r25plb_00202,Oh wow I looooove the new theme!
202,r25plb_00203,Dougal!!!!
203,r25plb_00204,
204,r25plb_00205,OH NEW LINE UP AFTER THE CREDITS
205,r25plb_00206,Desirée's been to some sorority parties in the past.
206,r25plb_00207,"Never change, VCM. Never change."
207,r25plb_00208,David Correos would nail this task.
208,r25plb_00209,Alex Corren-Horne. Victoria Corren-Mitchell-Horne.
209,r25plb_00210,THE VOICE: TASKMASTER
210,r25plb_00211,Holy shit Alan
211,r25plb_00212,Morgana's monster noise reminded me a bit of Mike Patton
212,r25plb_00213,Bridget Christie! Ardal O’Hanlon! Amazing.
213,r25plb_00214,Couldn't think of a better season finale. The proposal task and the live task have to be two of my favorites. Morgana is a worthy winner.
214,r25plb_00215,Alan one last time bringing in something from a different TV programme.
215,r25plb_00216,I love when the contestants lose their patience with Alex
216,r25plb_00217,All good marriage proposals involve a barrel.
217,r25plb_00218,Victoria’s dress is gorgeous.
218,r25plb_00219,Morgana doing the last pre recorded task made me feel like I was having a weird horny fever dream
219,r25plb_00220,"Just hit play right now. My magnificent floppy thing would be a boat sail made of posters for Greg's show ""You magnificent beast"""
220,r25plb_00221,As an American this is the first series I watched week to week because I only found the show during quarantine. Morgana was my early fave but this cast has been absolutely phenomenal.
221,r25plb_00222,I made noises not dissimilar to Alans monster impression laughing at that final task.
222,r25plb_00223,Fantastic episode to end the season! The final task felt perfect and the live task was brilliant. First season I genuinely would have been happy with any of the contestants winning. Loved this cast from the jump and I'm gonna miss them
223,r25plb_00224,I'm curious how David proposed to Victoria lol. Anyone know if this series has any outtakes? I loved seeing the ones from Series 11 and such
224,r25plb_00225,Ah so Desiree is still a student
225,r25plb_00226,Imagine not immediately accepting that proposal
226,r25plb_00227,OH MY GOD ALAN 😂
227,r25plb_00228,I’m crying
228,r25plb_00229,It's actually unhealthy how excited I am to find out the next 5
229,r25plb_00230,A God damn worthy champion
230,r25plb_00231,Season was phenomenal. Final Task was fantastic. Do we know if CoC is going to be the holiday special? Or are they doing another one off like previous New Years?
231,r25plb_00232,We were one point away from a series tie! We were this close!
232,r25plb_00233,I've been really invested in this wood working series thanks to Taskmaster. Lol
233,r25plb_00234,How has it been 10 weeks already?!
234,r25plb_00235,Taaaaskmaster's oooooon. Iiiiiit is on nooooooow.
235,r25plb_00236,I’m going to miss Victoria bullshitting Greg so much.
236,r25plb_00237,I'm so glad she brought a wacky waving tube man because that was my immediate first thought!
237,r25plb_00238,Wacky inflatable tube man was a great entry
238,r25plb_00239,Tip for this task: your tongue goes to the roof of your mouth when you swallow. Use that and you should be able to swallow even with your mouth open.
239,r25plb_00240,OH MY GOD VICKY 😂
240,r25plb_00241,Another perfect example of how the simplest tasks are the better ones
241,r25plb_00242,How do you discard a straw and go for the task-funnel?
242,r25plb_00243,My dad has just taken his blood pressure. I think Guz reminded him he needed to!
243,r25plb_00244,Attempted this in the break. Fountained water all over myself. Tried again. Found a technique. Strangely proud of myself
244,r25plb_00245,Poor Victoria will never amount to much. Her dreams will remain dreams.
245,r25plb_00246,"Just a tiny bit sexy? Sorry Morgana, I love you but thats just not true"
246,r25plb_00247,They really backloaded the best tasks this series. Very NZ vibes with this proposal.
247,r25plb_00248,They missed a trick not having this task in a series with Tim Key or Mark Watson.
248,r25plb_00249,That is the best noise I've ever heard
249,r25plb_00250,What an incredible finale. Probably my favorite finale since series 7 (though S9 comes close)
250,r25plb_00251,oh my god I forgot about the sand how could we let Desiree live this down
251,r25plb_00252,Guz could sell me anything
252,r25plb_00253,Another special prize from VCM.
253,r25plb_00254,Victoria is a broken women
254,r25plb_00255,Third leg on floppy Davies.
255,r25plb_00256,Alan’s prize has big knitted Noel Fielding vibes.
256,r25plb_00257,New kink from Alex Horne.
257,r25plb_00258,"Wait, only 5 points separating them? Depending on how the rest of the tasks play out, it could be anyone's game (barring Victoria, obviously)."
258,r25plb_00259,I didn't even know people had problems swallowing with their mouth open. For me it's as easy as drinking normally. Maybe it's like ear wiggling and some have always been able to do it?
259,r25plb_00260,Trevor McDonald's Giant Floating Head for Series 13.
260,r25plb_00261,get some muscular women and the singer pink to deliver the proposal
261,r25plb_00262,They're leaving Morgana and Victoria's proposals as the last prerecorded tasks to show. Either going to be spectacular or an absolute failure
262,r25plb_00263,Morgana is insane. I love her
263,r25plb_00264,Well that just solidified it. Morgana is my dream woman.
264,r25plb_00265,That was class from Morgana
265,r25plb_00266,"As we all know, to beatbox you have to say boots and cats over and over really fast."
266,r25plb_00267,"This is such a fun game to play along with, eyes closed"
267,r25plb_00268,
268,r25plb_00269,Congratulations to Morgana! No complaints about her winning here!
269,r25plb_00270,Well deserved winner.
270,r25plb_00271,this is by far the best episode of the series now that everyone seems loosened up and banter went a bit sharper
271,r25plb_00272,Finally tonight we get to find out what that thing with Green Morgana in the bath is. Probably.
272,r25plb_00273,Morgana looked like a paralysed Mark Watson during that task
273,r25plb_00274,Oh Victoria...
274,r25plb_00275,the bosh gauntlet has really been passed around this series.
275,r25plb_00276,"Surely you just down the pint, the glass between your lips will stop them closing?"
276,r25plb_00277,Guz took no chances.
277,r25plb_00278,Lmao she's a siren
278,r25plb_00279,TAIL
279,r25plb_00280,I love this task SO MUCH.
280,r25plb_00281,Incredible deduction from Greg.
281,r25plb_00282,Victoria's done with this.
282,r25plb_00283,"YES! Morgana tops the leaderboard! I win my bet, and I get a steak dinner!"
283,r25plb_00284,Who are the new 5? Genuinely don't think I've heard or seen them in anything before. First time I don't have a known favourite going into a new series.
284,r25plb_00285,"One of my favorite parts of this episode is the cut between Morgana drinking with her mouth wiiide open and spilling everything, to Alan just drinking normally"
285,r25plb_00286,"Incredible episode! Easily the best tasks all series. Congratulations to Morgana, a worthy winner!"
286,r25plb_00287,"It occurred to me a moment after the fact, even though granted yes he did know what the nature of the task was ahead of time, it's rather impressive that Greg got as much of Morgana's ""message"" that he did considering he couldn't have possibly seen the entire thing. I mean, unless there winds up being more playback footage shown in studio in the moment than what we're seeing in the broadcast record. But if he simply saw what we did, the edited ensemble of both Morgana's & Guz's activity, that wouldn't contain the actual entirety of what she performed on the day. It would just be most of it."
287,r25plb_00288,This season has flown by more so than any that I've watched weelk-to-week. I'm not ready to say goodbye to this cast.
288,r25plb_00289,Battlefield Earth! VCM should win just for that.
289,r25plb_00290,Claudia is on taskmaster!!!!
290,r25plb_00291,Wow floppy Alan is hung
291,r25plb_00292,OLLIE!
292,r25plb_00293,"Well, Victoria's getting disqualified."
293,r25plb_00294,I feel like everyone now is trying to see if they can drink with their mouth open.
294,r25plb_00295,Alan gonna be putting out his own David Correos calendar with these poses.
295,r25plb_00296,That well known phrase.
296,r25plb_00297,Anyone taken the handle CaringUncleMinpit yet?
297,r25plb_00298,Oh my fucking god
298,r25plb_00299,"Don't worry, guys! Morgana promised she's crab free!"
299,r25plb_00300,That walk at the end killed me 😂😂😂
300,r25plb_00301,Morgana is going to do impressions of everyone
301,r25plb_00302,This live task is absolutely brilliant!
302,r25plb_00303,MORGANA DID IT
303,r25plb_00304,PEOPLE’S CHAMP!!!!
304,r25plb_00305,"Well done everyone who predicted Judi Love, she'll be great!"
305,r25plb_00306,"Great final, great final task!"
306,r25plb_00307,"I'm also in the camp that doesn't like Judi Love at all. However, Ardal O'Hanlon!"
307,r25plb_00308,Am I weird if I drink like Desiree usually? I drink bottles of water as fast as it takes for them to empty when held upside down.
308,r25plb_00309,Thursdays without Taskmaster just aren't the same. Wonder if we will get a tease of the new series like the finale of season 11.
309,r25plb_00310,Im hoping for a Mr Greedy Esq appearance
310,r25plb_00311,Desiree Is looking great
311,r25plb_00312,GUZ SHITHOUSERY
312,r25plb_00313,I love Victoria so much lol
313,r25plb_00314,I JUST JOINED AND DONT LNOW WHAT THE DRINK WAS WHAT WAS IT
314,r25plb_00315,Oh my fucking God
315,r25plb_00316,Holy crap Desiree
316,r25plb_00317,"Ellie taylor on an ad, possible she's on S13? Been banging this drum for a while now, and she had a kid quite recently. might be desperate to get out of the house like Rob / Josh were"
317,r25plb_00318,One part left of the series and I have no idea who’s going to win
318,r25plb_00319,Sherlock Davies there
319,r25plb_00320,YES MORGANA
320,r25plb_00321,"Happy with Morgana, that was a close winner!"
321,r25plb_00322,Hopefully Taskmaster does its usual thing and make me love every cast member. Even Judi Love somehow.
322,r25plb_00323,It’s been a great series gonna miss Theo I’ve discussion and everyone drooling over Morgana
323,r25plb_00324,Is the episode done airing? I'm from the YouTube squad.
324,r25plb_00325,We get the next contestants!
325,r25plb_00326,"Can’t wait to see Victoria’s magnificent floppy thing. Hope Greedy, esq makes his long awaited return."
326,r25plb_00327,"Alan trying to jump onto Guz's ""enter yourself for a win"" boat."
327,r25plb_00328,This is going to be chaos
328,r25plb_00329,Wtf desiree
329,r25plb_00330,1 point between Morgana and Guz now
0,rtrrvd_00001,I have never laughed harder than when Claudia was doing the pole challenge. My dogs were seriously concerned 😭😭
1,rtrrvd_00002,"as much as I like alan davies, would’ve loved to see jonnie on set. he seemed like a fan of the show. shame about the disqualification."
2,rtrrvd_00003,But what was Basic Recipe 28? I completely missed that part!
3,rtrrvd_00004,Does this mean that the UK's first chair curse is broken?
4,rtrrvd_00005,Does anyone know if it was recorded before season 10 or at a point in 2021 where they could have an audience. Because the inclusion of an audience was a suprise when I saw them there.
5,rtrrvd_00006,My god I’ve got tears in my eyes with Alex saying it is orange
6,rtrrvd_00007,"So it’s only now that I found out that Warsi was a Tory. which is a shame, because she seemed nice enough on the show and it turns out she’s part of the party which hates just about everyone. That sucks. But hey, everyone else was great! Would’ve loved to have seen a full series with Chiles, Winkleman, Leshurr and Peacock. They’re all fantastic personalities!"
7,rtrrvd_00008,"“It is orange!” Holy shit, Alex. Brutal."
8,rtrrvd_00009,"Adrian: ""There's only so much joy you can get from a shower head"" Leshur: 👀"
9,rtrrvd_00010,Jonnie has 100% watched the show before
10,rtrrvd_00011,"Never thought Adrian Chiles would win a MOBO, but here we are. What a treat this was."
11,rtrrvd_00012,"Leshurr was robbed for that egg task, her salmon and egg beyblade catch was genuinely impressive"
12,rtrrvd_00013,"I did not have Adrian Chiles down as an absolute legend, that was fantastic"
13,rtrrvd_00014,The first chair curse is broken
14,rtrrvd_00015,"Love how in less than one episode Jonnie has established himself as the quintessential “Excellent idea, disappointing execution” contestant."
15,rtrrvd_00016,"""it is orange"" Mouths F#ck you! And gives Alex the finger Amazing!!!"
16,rtrrvd_00017,"When she screamed ""Beyblade!"" as she released her salmon-wrapped egg, I felt so represented by Lady Leshurr"
17,rtrrvd_00018,If Adrian and Greg go camping isn't a series by the end of the year I'm going to be upset.
18,rtrrvd_00019,LOL They actually changed Adrian's portrait at the end
19,rtrrvd_00020,Lady Leshurr just hammering them like she is on a bender in Ibiza ha ha
20,rtrrvd_00021,"So much to love about this episode: “I watched a documentary about vinegar”, Adrian Chiles’ egg in eggcup attempt, Claudia Winkleman, ”Well it is orange”. One of my all time favourite TM episodes for sure."
21,rtrrvd_00022,"Excellent bit of editing there: *Leshurr's pole POV triumphantly passing through the tyre* *Cut to shot of her leaning through the tyre, stuck*"
22,rtrrvd_00023,Absolutely buckled at “it is orange”
23,rtrrvd_00024,"INCREDIBLY strong opener from all five contestants, they are all shiny and beguiling things. (I cannot believe Jonnie cheerfully slung a copper petal from the 2012 Olympic Torch into the mix, my god, that's a priceless heirloom)"
24,rtrrvd_00025,That shot of Lady Leshurr just holding the pole through the tyres killed me.
25,rtrrvd_00026,SIX POINTS 😂😂😂
26,rtrrvd_00027,Delighted for Adrian to win his first MOBO award!
27,rtrrvd_00028,I would have LOVED to see Claudia and Alex's relationship develop through a series! The end with the orange remark and Claudia giving him the middle finger was so classic.
28,rtrrvd_00029,“It is orange” is such a savage read by Alex.
29,rtrrvd_00030,"We only got one episode, but just from what we saw, I'd say that Adrian is one of the strongest taskmaster players we've ever seen."
30,rtrrvd_00031,'A documentary on vinegars' must have been a candidate for episode title
31,rtrrvd_00032,I did not expect my favourite contestant on this episode to be Adrian Chiles.
32,rtrrvd_00033,I so wish we could have got Lady Leshurr for ten episodes. So much chaotic energy and a real spark to her. Had no idea who she was before but I cherished her appearance here.
33,rtrrvd_00034,"Has probably already been said, but it's incredibly refreshing to have the audience back"
34,rtrrvd_00035,"When Lady Leshurr suggested beyblading the egg with a piece of salmon I could not stop cackling, the fact that it actually ended up working was incredible."
35,rtrrvd_00036,Alex legit watching Adrian Chile's with an egg in his mouth crawling on concrete with no pants on and realising he's found a kindred spirit who shares his public humiliation fetish.
36,rtrrvd_00037,"Obviously Claudia is a horrible drunk, she never drinks water."
37,rtrrvd_00038,The final scoreboard using the big blue head for Adrian was so subtle but such a lovely touch
38,rtrrvd_00039,"During the prize task when Chiles is talking about descaling, there's a fucking hilarious slight zoom in at Lady's reaction after he cheekily says ""there's only so much joy you can get from a shower head""."
39,rtrrvd_00040,This is the type of uncomplicated ridiculous shit the last series was missing
40,rtrrvd_00041,Conflicted emotions. Gutted that Claudia is on this and not a regular series but I'm happy to see her on it.
41,rtrrvd_00042,Well it is orange. That made me spit out my drink.
42,rtrrvd_00043,"Alex was having a blast, never seen him so loose before."
43,rtrrvd_00044,Adrian Chiles properly 'got' the prize task in a way that I feel like we haven't seen for a long time.
44,rtrrvd_00045,I think I'm sad that Lady Leshurr is a one episoder already.
45,rtrrvd_00046,The nemesis energy between Claudia and Alex was absolutely beautiful.
46,rtrrvd_00047,I hope they had special task asking Claudia to drink a glass of water. “Let’s unravel it” to rival “Let’s drill down the narrative “
47,rtrrvd_00048,I was crying from laughing so hard at the pole task. Such a great task. I hadn't heard of anyone really except Claudia but they were all brilliant. Loved seeing Alan but it's a shame Jonnie Peacock couldn't be there because I really enjoyed watching his tasks. He really went for it and I get the feeling he's seen the show.
48,rtrrvd_00049,"Never thought Chiles would be my favourite but he was pitch perfect, best out of a very strong cast!!"
49,rtrrvd_00050,"I had thought it was a bad idea to have a politician as a contestant, but hoped the sheer joy of TM would be enough to overcome any awkwardness - but Warsi's very first words being along the lines of ""I'm first generation British from 2 immigrant parents"" couldn't help but jarringly remind of the vile things her party has done under the guise of immigration control, after which I was immediately pulled out of my enjoyment literally every time she appeared. Really, *any* mixing of politics with the most delightful, irreverent show on TV is going to be clunky at best. Hope they won't be doing that again. On the bright side, everyone else was great, even Adrian Chiles who I had very low expectations for."
50,rtrrvd_00051,ITS ORANGE
51,rtrrvd_00052,"Lady Leshurr charging at the tire with her pole and immediately getting stuck was absolutely hilarious, as was her running into the door. Never thought Adrian Chiles could be so funny but he is dry as a bone and surprisingly brilliant at Taskmaster. Sad we won’t get more of him."
52,rtrrvd_00053,"That was a brilliant episode. Five strong contestants and brilliant tasks. I think that Claudia has had one of the lowest scores of any contestant and Adrian had one of the highest. I've always liked Adrian. I saw him interviewed on RHLSTP a couple of years ago and he's very funny, intelligent and an engaging raconteur. And good to see that replaced his photo in the final scoreboard with his real head"
53,rtrrvd_00054,"Oh, it's nice to see them all snuggly together instead of spaced out. Also, Lady Leshurr is so wee and tiny, Greg could put her in his pocket."
54,rtrrvd_00055,I need a full series of Claudia and Alex. Need.
55,rtrrvd_00056,Get Adrian Chiles on the main series please.
56,rtrrvd_00057,I wish every prize task was like this one - both in concept and effort from contestants
57,rtrrvd_00058,"Did anyone see Alex had a golf ball drop out his pocket, picking it up , all while following Claudia in her pole task? Whaly did he have a golf ball in his pocket? They weren't used in the special for any of the tasks. Just curious 🙂"
58,rtrrvd_00059,"Adrian Chiles : ""Dignity intact, dignity intact!"""
59,rtrrvd_00060,"""I got heavily into ironing tea towels"""
60,rtrrvd_00061,So refreshing to have the chairs side by side and an audience back. Do we know if that’s what s13 will be?
61,rtrrvd_00062,"At first I was a bit worried about this one. With Warsi being a conservative politician (which, if nothing else, Greg does like to poke fun at tories), and Claudia always being someone who I don't... dislike at all, but I guess she's one of those people where I never understood why she was famous. But I was pleasantly surprised! Adrian is a bit unassuming looking, but the moment he just stripped right off and started crawling on the ground as a ""daring"" move was great. Lady Leshurr was really funny, and I would have loved to see her in a full season. I'm sad we couldn't get Jonnie Peacock in the studio - from his tasks he came off like a funny and pretty smart dude. Always good to see Alan back, but I was kind of surprised that he wasn't ""fighting for"" Jonnie much like Kerry and Katherine Parkinson did for Katy Wix. I guess he didn't really need to too much. Also, what good tasks in general! You can really see how Alex knows to get a range to them. One ""sporty"" one with the poll, one ""intelligence"" based one with the vinegar, and then kind of a ""creativity"" one with the egg. Really shows everyone off well. Long winded but, it's a good little special - and if nothing else it's really nice to see Alex lay down a sick burn in the studio task."
62,rtrrvd_00063,"If only peacock boiled his egg before his attempt, that was daring!"
63,rtrrvd_00064,Absolutely outraged I didn't notice any of the 85s until Jonnie did. The bloody cushions!
64,rtrrvd_00065,I loved every second of that pretty much. Great having an audience. I would happily have any of them on a full series. Adrian Chiles was especially good. But that Alex comment about the basketball and Claudia's reaction....absolutely hilarious.
65,rtrrvd_00066,"Holy shit, was not expecting this treat. So weird to see everyone so close together and a full unmasked studio audience. When was this filmed? Will the next season be filmed the same way? It was a great, eclectic bunch and I really started to dig their vibe by the end. Somehow I feel like the rankings at the end of this episode would have been the same even after a full season. The pole task was probably the most entertaining, but I really enjoyed the reveals of all the heads at the end of the live task. Damn, I miss Taskmaster already after only one episode."
66,rtrrvd_00067,"Another year, another heartbreak that this is the first & last we see of this cast."
67,rtrrvd_00068,I don't think I was actually prepared for the size of that rubber duck.
68,rtrrvd_00069,"This entire episode was so, SO good. Lady Leshurr running straight into the door with her pole had me crying. Then getting the camera's view of going smoothly through the tires, only to pan out and see her stuck in the first tire...I lost it. This is a great start to the new year!"
69,rtrrvd_00070,Jonnie seemed great during the tasks. Shame he couldn't make it.
70,rtrrvd_00071,You can only get so much love from a shower head. 😁
71,rtrrvd_00072,"Ok, am I the only one who, for a very mad moment, thought when Adrian stepped out of the caravan in his underwear, that he had stuck the egg up himself and was going to, um, shit it into the cup? In retrospect I know this could only be broadcast on the dark web but it’s where my mind went?? It was a wonderful episode. I thought Sayeeda Warsi brought a very, like, awkward precocious clever child energy? It was all a bit Breakfast Club: Adrian the stoner, Claudia the… um, Claudia, Jonnie the jock, Lesha the cool girl, and Sayeeda the nerd (“I watched a documentary about vinegar!”). I found Sayeeda endearing and I say this as a major Toryphobe."
72,rtrrvd_00073,"fantastic episode loved lady leshurr's enthusiasm and excitement to be there. adrian with the egg...just...lmao. claudia was an awesome wreck. the baroness killed the live task. would have liked to seen jonnie in studio but alan was a good stand in. i wish we could have had a full series with them my two fav moments have to be leshurr running pole first into the door and alex with the ""well it is orange""."
73,rtrrvd_00074,Claudia was as absolute rubbish at the tasks as I’d expect- love her
74,rtrrvd_00075,"Next time someone can't be present and needs a substitute, if it's a ""shitty at tasks"" competitor, use Lee Mack as a sub. I'm sure he will be great at making excuses to justify why the shitty task attempt we just watched is actually a very good attempt and deserves a 5."
75,rtrrvd_00076,"Having not really seen Claudia on anything before, I'm absolutely understanding why her & VCM are besties."
76,rtrrvd_00077,"Wow, Alex is fired up tonight! ""It is orange!"""
77,rtrrvd_00078,"The pole task was one of the best tasks in the history of taskmaster. I was howling with laughter at Claudia and Lady Leshurr. Also, Adrian Chile's is a miss for a full series. He would of been a good contestant."
78,rtrrvd_00079,"Stray thoughts: My first reaction was ""WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SO CLOSE TOGETHER"", then I remembered that's what the first 9 series looked like There must have been a significant amount of tongue biting (or editing out) when a tory peer started shouting ""you can't cancel my therapy"". I think it may be difficult to use politicians going forward, especially those who are practicing Tories. They're a natural target for comedians to attack, but I imagine that can make things a bit awkward in studio. Gutted that Johnny couldn't do the studio part, he seems like he'd be a laugh. I thought they might have gotten Johnny Vegas, as they somewhat know eachother. Adrian seems like a nice enough chap, if a bit odd. He spent a good 10 minutes on the podcast talking about how he descales bathrooms. I knew nothing of Lady leshurr prior to this, but she seems fun enough. Could probably do well in some presenting roles"
79,rtrrvd_00080,"Fun fact, one of my mates really confused Adrian Chiles when he was having a coffee in Vienna, Austria. He was out there for the Euros and we were out there on a stag do and my ever so slightly worse for wear mate thought he was Ray Mears so shouted at him “Where’s your kayak?”. My mate is not a smart man."
80,rtrrvd_00081,"""I never regret big blue balls."" Someone's gonna lose a peerage..."
81,rtrrvd_00082,Alan is a joy at live tasks
82,rtrrvd_00083,"My favorite from this episode was Lady Leshurr, would love to see her on a full season"
83,rtrrvd_00084,So question the person in first chair has never won a series until this episode does this count to break the first chair curse
84,rtrrvd_00085,"I was expecting to only like Claudia and ended up with Adrian Chiles in my top 10. When he was crawling with the egg in his mouth...oh, man, I had to pause it because I couldn't breathe from the laughter"
85,rtrrvd_00086,"""Ah, shut up!"" got me laughing hard."
86,rtrrvd_00087,Alan Davies showing he is a pro ha ha all about the haggle and banter for them sweet points :)
87,rtrrvd_00088,"damn, I wish this was a full series! all of them were outstanding, sad that Jonnie was ill but his filmed tasks were great. and although I've seen lots of criticism of Baroness Warsi on this sub beforehand, there's no denying she was hilarious in this episode (but I'm not from the UK so I'm sure people have a valid reason to not want her on TM)"
88,rtrrvd_00089,"Quite glad the silent film motif made a comeback. I assume now it’ll be used for every New Years Treat. I didn’t memorize the names and descriptions that I read from the pre publicity. So I had totally forgotten what Adrian and Johnnie were famous for. (American) In fact, during the intros I had the thought “huh, that guy looks a lot like Alan Davies”. Greg and Alex actually did precious little to tell us during the episode. I just realized that the drink vinegar task required Claudia to ingest liquids, and we know from Off Menu she loathes drinking water. I had thought that the liquids would be on alphabetical order but the number was fun. Fun episode."
89,rtrrvd_00090,Peacock is the real deal. Hope he thinks of full series or comes for podcast to discuss the details
90,rtrrvd_00091,Probably the strongest episode this year.
91,rtrrvd_00092,"Chiles has always been brilliant, but he’s so understated that it often gets lost."
92,rtrrvd_00093,Says a lot about the attempt when Alex can't contain his laughter
93,rtrrvd_00094,"Well, that was once again an absolute ruddy delight. Taskmaster is becoming a lovely way to ring in the new year."
94,rtrrvd_00095,"Alternative episode titles: Nothing complicated. Skanky urn man. Oak smoked salmon. Camping with Adrian. The dramatic's over. Kneel on concrete. A documentary on vinegars. Ram raid the house. Quotebook: You can only get so much joy from a shower head. That's what you like, no dicking around. Off to the loo block together. Once it's got a personality, it had to go in the right way up. If you can't go over it, you've got to go under it. Whatever the result of this, I'm going to challenge it. Oh stop it, you evil man! This is so dispiriting. Stop speaking, make it smaller. That was so nearly brilliant. I never regret big blue balls. It is orange."
95,rtrrvd_00096,"Is she just having breakfast? If so, fair play."
96,rtrrvd_00097,Bonus Alan Davies!...plus an audience! Hurrah
97,rtrrvd_00098,If he just boiled the egg first that would have been quality.
98,rtrrvd_00099,"For the eggcup task, my personal approach would be to just plonk the egg into the cup, no theatrics whatsoever. My reasoning? Well, greg would pretty likely not buy this description on why it is daring, therefore, I am at risk, which is a daring act to do"
99,rtrrvd_00100,Loving Lady Leshurr so far!
100,rtrrvd_00101,"My god, I want every single one of these idiots back on for a full series. Magnificent!"
101,rtrrvd_00102,"I’m a bit gutted Jonnie wasn’t there for the studio, was very curious to see how his banter would have been."
102,rtrrvd_00103,"It's so good to see them all sitting so close together! Especially Greg and Alex. And the audience back! Omicron, don't you dare mess this up."
103,rtrrvd_00104,I wasn't expecting to see Adrian Chiles legs I will be honest....plus loose boxers...daring!
104,rtrrvd_00105,Everyone hyped up Winkleman but I'd love Leshurr or Jonnie on a full season.
105,rtrrvd_00106,"Loved it. Loved all the contestants but contraversially, Winkleman does nothing for me! Would have loved Johnnie or Adrian on a full series."
106,rtrrvd_00107,Jonnie has a lovely flair for the dramatic. Shame it didn't work.
107,rtrrvd_00108,Holy shit Jonnie.
108,rtrrvd_00109,"Claudia, Alan, Jonnie and Lady Leshur would have all been great on full series! Really loved Jonnnie's approach to tasks, absolute madman for attempting that pole length and the daring egg. Edit: Alan was meant to be jonnie hahah. My bad."
109,rtrrvd_00110,I’m sad we won’t see Lady Leshurr on a full season because she was such a standout for me
110,rtrrvd_00111,First seat curse lifted!!!
111,rtrrvd_00112,Well I loved that. Lady Leshurr and her pole had me crying^
112,rtrrvd_00113,It’s so good seeing and hearing the audience again. Wonder if Alex is as happy knowing he’s back within touching distance of Greg again.
113,rtrrvd_00114,"""nope. I never regret a big blue ball."" This year's contestants are such gems."
114,rtrrvd_00115,I want a salmon and egg beyblade now.
115,rtrrvd_00116,Fair to say the pole task is up there as one of the show’s best tasks. Absolutely incredible entertainment.
116,rtrrvd_00117,
117,rtrrvd_00118,"I was rooting for Adrian during this, I think Jonnie could have got the five points if his egg didn't break, I was losing it during the pole task and I loved the chaos of the live task."
118,rtrrvd_00119,"Adrian was goddamn brilliant, like he'd been doing it his whole life. Love to see him back!"
119,rtrrvd_00120,Looks like Adrian might break the 1st seat curse
120,rtrrvd_00121,Crying actual tears at the pole task. Beautifully chaotic
121,rtrrvd_00122,That was an amazing episode. That's 2 for 2 of New Years episodes castings I wish we had a full series of now though lol :(
122,rtrrvd_00123,Amazingly strong cast. Also the perfect sort of task to give non-comedians.
123,rtrrvd_00124,A particular Claudia Winkleman may have attended Josh Widdicombe’s school of throwing eggs on the grass
124,rtrrvd_00125,"All three older ones have absolutely lost their fucking minds on this egg task, amazing."
125,rtrrvd_00126,"Just like last year, I wish we got 10 episodes for this cast."
126,rtrrvd_00127,"I'm in awe. I was in tears for most of the episode, actually bloody clapping at the screen a couple times like someone who believes in fairies. Warsi had me at her opening gambit. It was funnier than some comedians prize task banter. To see the lovely legs of Chiles, and then him putting a whole bloody egg in his mouth without breaking it! Something stirred within me. Clauds didn't wow me, prolly cuz I was expecting so much from her. Peacock was just brilliantly competitive. So sad we didn't get his banter. Leshurr. Yeah. She was fun! But none of her antics really stood out to me. I gotta watch it again now. The best single episode of Taskmaster ever, in my mind - if only for ""Well, it is orange!"""
127,rtrrvd_00128,Claudia's pole is going to have negative length by the end of this.
128,rtrrvd_00129,"These are great tasks, much better than last year's NYT"
129,rtrrvd_00130,"Omg this was everything I wanted it to be. Claudia was as bat shit crazy, charming and lovable as ever. Wish we could get a whole series with her but I’m glad we got her at all. So happy right now. Thank you Taskmaster team!"
130,rtrrvd_00131,"What an episode - winkleman did not disappoint when she brought the chaos, lady leshurr was fantastic, johnnie/Alan were great in their own ways and the baroness/AC were pretty funny straight folks. Loved the whole thing especially the Alex/ Claudia dynamic!"
131,rtrrvd_00132,Seeing everybody close just hits different.
132,rtrrvd_00133,Watching the vinger task with my mum saying surely it is going to be the red shot glasses as that is the universal indicator for acid. Bold to assume this program actually conforms to any logic.
133,rtrrvd_00134,They broke the curse!
134,rtrrvd_00135,"An absolute classic episode. I'd love any of them to move up to the main series, if that's allowed."
135,rtrrvd_00136,I want to love something as much as this lady love salmon
136,rtrrvd_00137,I love how the ad idents are celebrating the return of the studio audience.
137,rtrrvd_00138,"i think these treats are always so sad. i want full series with these chaotic gods. the audience has been the jey element missing from past shows tbh, im glad theyre back"
138,rtrrvd_00139,The thing that pleased me the most is that the cow is called Linda.
139,rtrrvd_00140,Alan laying down the truth
140,rtrrvd_00141,He's fucked it by knocking it over.... And SAVED!
141,rtrrvd_00142,First instinct for the shots - pour them all into a bucket and down First instinct for the pole - go for as long as it can go
142,rtrrvd_00143,"Absolutely brilliant episode. Really enjoyable tasks, excellent chemistry amongst the contestants who were enjoyable in the tasks too. Can’t wait for S13 when we get a whole series with the audience back."
143,rtrrvd_00144,"Bloody loved that. End to end greatness, I don't think there was 1 second of that episode that I didn't find entertaining."
144,rtrrvd_00145,I somehow missed Alex telling Greg “You’re a mouthful and so is the category” on first watch I loved the way Greg was already cracking up in anticipation just a few words into Alan’s prize banter
145,rtrrvd_00146,Aww they are all sitting close again!
146,rtrrvd_00147,That Beyblade opening is gonna be stuck in my head for days again now. IT'S BEYYYYYYYYYYBLAAAADE
147,rtrrvd_00148,I hope this doesn’t awaken anything in me
148,rtrrvd_00149,No Adriurn Chiles joke? I am disappointed
149,rtrrvd_00150,"I didn’t enjoy last year’s special at all, but this was GREAT. I’d enjoy it even more if there was a version with Baroness Warsi edited out."
150,rtrrvd_00151,"What a remarkable episode. I think that's my favourite non main series episode so far. We'll see how CoC2 goes. That could have been episode 6 of a full series and I'd believe you based on how quickly those 5 warmed to each other and interacted with one another. Maybe that's to do with finally being back together again, but it was a great selection of personalities yet again."
151,rtrrvd_00152,"I'm not from the UK and didn't know 4 of the contestants beforehand (kinda knew Claudia) and I was so confused by the titles? Like, is Lady a name or a title, and is the baroness really a baroness? Sometimes they referred to them by their first name, sometimes their last name, sometimes by a title, I don't get it ^^"
152,rtrrvd_00153,Was that a ping pong ball Alex just knocked out the tree then picked up?
153,rtrrvd_00154,Leshurr and Claudia would make a wonderfully chaotic team
154,rtrrvd_00155,Both ‘new year specials’ have had absolutely outstanding casts. I already love the energy of this group.
155,rtrrvd_00156,That live task is amazing
156,rtrrvd_00157,I have always loved Claudia and this was just marvellous
157,rtrrvd_00158,Bwahaha what the fuck!
158,rtrrvd_00159,"Baroness Warsi is having a lovely day out with her window cleaning pole, gods bless her."
159,rtrrvd_00160,"Is the smartest thing here not just to extend the pole to its maximum, to give yourself plenty that can be subtracted? And then maybe just put it in the floor and slide it so it’s one continuous touch?"
160,rtrrvd_00161,Cannot wait to see Claudia. Think the only disappointment will be her only being a one episode contestant.
161,rtrrvd_00162,"Jonny Peacock’s a fibber - I used to work for a theatre company who was involved in the 2012 Paralympic opening ceremony, our boss was co-artistic producer of the ceremony and was also gifted a petal from the cauldron thingy. Consider the Peacock debunked!"
162,rtrrvd_00163,My first thought: Only some of those are vinegar and there's some sort of logic to the madness.
163,rtrrvd_00164,Sayeeda seemed like a pro. The things they pick up in the House of Lords.
164,rtrrvd_00165,Mischievous LAH!
165,rtrrvd_00166,I would love to have a full series with this cast. They were absolutely brilliant!
166,rtrrvd_00167,I think this is one of the best episodes of the whole show. It's a pity we won't get a full season with this cast.
167,rtrrvd_00168,Bit of eye liner of course.
168,rtrrvd_00169,Check out those calves.
169,rtrrvd_00170,was the number 85 in the task ident thing a clue?
170,rtrrvd_00171,Jonnie!!!! Lol I have spilled all the vinegar...
171,rtrrvd_00172,I have never seen a task that I would be irreparably shit at than this don't touch anything with the pole task
172,rtrrvd_00173,"Anyway, a lovely little treat ahead of the next series in spring. I will never get bored of this show."
173,rtrrvd_00174,"That was amazing and makes me wish it was a full series. Alex and Claudia are perfect together, Sayeeda's bonkers and Adrian and is a hoot!"
174,rtrrvd_00175,Great tasks in this episode!
175,rtrrvd_00176,Well that was bloody delightful! How I wish we could have had a full ten episodes of these people. They're all mad as a box of frogs.
176,rtrrvd_00177,"What is it at the beginning that Alex says about Johnny Peacock? He's ""poorly""?"
177,rtrrvd_00178,It looked like steam was coming from Linda the cow’s nostrils during Claudia’s egg throw—has that been a Linda thing before?
178,rtrrvd_00179,"Oh Jonnie, no!"
179,rtrrvd_00180,OH MY GOD 😂
180,rtrrvd_00181,Excellent contestants and excellent tasks. Wonderful to have the audience back too. What a great episode.
181,rtrrvd_00182,Great to see them sitting back together and an audience back in :D
182,rtrrvd_00183,Love the eyebrow trophy.
183,rtrrvd_00184,Is that ed gamble voice for the Cazoo ad?
184,rtrrvd_00185,"Okay, I’ll take Claudia Winkleman for a full series now pls"
185,rtrrvd_00186,Couldn’t you wrap the pole in a large tarpaulin (if you can find one large enough) or cling wrap for one continuous touch and then go through the course without worrying about any further touches?
186,rtrrvd_00187,"I surprised how i liked adrian chiles, he used to do football presenting for itv years ago and i hated him. I liked him in this taskmaster."
187,rtrrvd_00188,It gooped.
188,rtrrvd_00189,"Claudia going full ""Mum"" with that attempt."
189,rtrrvd_00190,So are Chiles and Peacock better or much worse? There's a reason they're after the break.
190,rtrrvd_00191,"If this isn't the best Taskmaster episode ever, I don't know what is then"
191,rtrrvd_00192,Very into Alan wearing Kirk Van Houtens Pictionary Dignity hoodie.
192,rtrrvd_00193,This line up is joyous! I think I’ll be rewatching this later in the week.
193,rtrrvd_00194,"check if you can hear it gooping, claudia"
194,rtrrvd_00195,I can't work out if any of these are good
195,rtrrvd_00196,Love the laugh from Adrian.
196,rtrrvd_00197,I love this show so much!!
197,rtrrvd_00198,
198,rtrrvd_00199,Backing Chiles here
199,rtrrvd_00200,I missed them sitting all together!
200,rtrrvd_00201,that shut up has broken me
201,rtrrvd_00202,Incredible from Claudia.
202,rtrrvd_00203,Oh my Claudia.
203,rtrrvd_00204,Tears. Uncontrollable tears 🤣
204,rtrrvd_00205,What a great line up
205,rtrrvd_00206,What a wonderful episode!
206,rtrrvd_00207,I think for the Egg task I would’ve done a secret agent thing where the egg is the agent. And using like a zip line for the egg ascend into the egg cup. That would’ve been fun.
207,rtrrvd_00208,Anyone know where Sayeeda Warsi's top was from in the in-studio portion? I love it.
208,rtrrvd_00209,i wonder if alan will be seated on the left or where jonnie should be
209,rtrrvd_00210,I want to try the passing the pole through.. I could have opened the doors and checked the course before taking the pole from Horne
210,rtrrvd_00211,Why is alan for jonnie? My internet is shocking and not sure if I've missed something 😅
211,rtrrvd_00212,Oh man Johnnie
212,rtrrvd_00213,Hopefully I didn't miss anything further down in the thread but I want to avoid getting spoiled. Does anybody know when it hits YouTube?
213,rtrrvd_00214,"Lady Leshurr is such a funny lyricist, expecting big things from her"
214,rtrrvd_00215,Some writing flashed up on the carpet just before the ad break!
215,rtrrvd_00216,I was thinking about using the fact that vinegar was acidic
216,rtrrvd_00217,This first task is going to be a challenge. Trying to time turning on Taskmaster without spoiling Bake Off.
217,rtrrvd_00218,YES ADRIAN
218,rtrrvd_00219,sheeeeeet i forgot about this
0,rw0vgx_00001,It IS orange…
1,rw0vgx_00002,Not available in the US 😔
2,rw0vgx_00003,"Its available on YouTube, just look it up."
0,u3pbwn_00001,PLEASE DO NOT POST LINKS TO UNOFFICIAL COPIES OF THE EPISODE Series 13 Streaming Update
1,u3pbwn_00002,This was such a funny first ep ! They dont normally get this good so early? Which ones were the lockdown seasons ill avoid them ! Love this cast
2,u3pbwn_00003,So how are people that do not live in the UK are supposed to watch this? Not at all? You don't care?
3,u3pbwn_00004,Starting now. This episode was gold holy.
4,u3pbwn_00005,
5,u3pbwn_00006,ANYONE know the make of sophie dukers shoes in that purple suit? Can’t look past them.
6,u3pbwn_00007,Does anyone know what task the ghost duck that Judi found was from? The one that Alex said was from an old task...
7,u3pbwn_00008,"Judi and Ardal made me laugh the most so far, but it's a solid line-up in general. I have never seen Ardal on panel shows or anything outside of acting so it's really interesting to see (I love Father Ted). This series is off to a good start so far."
8,u3pbwn_00009,"It was a great first episode, but for some reason my favourite moment was when Ardal called Greg “TM” It was so wholesome"
9,u3pbwn_00010,Alex was so pleased with himself to get that first verse together.
10,u3pbwn_00011,Chris Ramsey is clearly a fan of the show making Alex take off his shirt and drink his tea
11,u3pbwn_00012,Ardal’s wholesome and polite shit talking
12,u3pbwn_00013,Someone in the sub earlier suggested a series of only lunatics. Well. Here it is.
13,u3pbwn_00014,"Maybe it’s too early to cast aspersions, but Ardal has seamlessly slipped into the middle aged man who’s just happy to be out of the house type of contestant."
14,u3pbwn_00015,The Herring picture inside the mysterious little box was top notch. I am here for this.
15,u3pbwn_00016,"He may have only found 2 ducks, but he still had an absolutely lovely day."
16,u3pbwn_00017,"""You're sort of steering me with your thighs"""
17,u3pbwn_00018,Contender for the longest continuous noise from Sophie there.
18,u3pbwn_00019,"""there was clearly no horses or donkeys I can get"" Bridget needs to contact Al Murray because he'll certainly know a donkey guy in the area"
19,u3pbwn_00020,Judie Love has big Guz Khan energy so far in the studio.
20,u3pbwn_00021,This episode had the energy of the New Years one offs but we’re getting a whole series with these lot. Banger first ep.
21,u3pbwn_00022,"I thought Ardal was just going to be the nice middle aged dad contestant. Turns out he’s the not here to make friends, he’s here to sabotage type of contestant."
0,u8viii_00001,"I'm American so for me ""Ruby Cuby"" was just that meme of ""is that really what they call it in England?"""
0,uj57pv_00001,"I’m happy to see people are enjoying this still, because this cast is really disappointing. Chris Ramsey is great and Sophie has her moments, but the other three are either negative, incompetent, lazy, or any combination of these. Put in zero effort to the prize task, or are just all bad at it. The show can handle one person like this, but it’s far less funny or charming when 3, on occasion 4 with Sophie, just seem like they’d rather not be there."
1,uj57pv_00002,Ardal has quickly become one of my favorite contestants ever. This episode made me laugh out loud at least four times. Great stuff! Just one thing... How do people not just automatically check under the table in the lab at this point?! It's like the best five seconds one could ever spend on this show!
2,uj57pv_00003,Why did Alex in the introduction said the prize task is in the top 109 when it is the 110 episode?
3,uj57pv_00004,"""This has happened before in shows this series, where Ardal has criticized a lot of people's attempts, partly building up to what I know he's done."" LMAO Also, this has gotta be the closest episode in TM history. Also Chris just really has so much puppy energy"
4,uj57pv_00005,"Finally watched this episode yesterday, the ""Get your fucking hand off me"" might be my favourite ever Greg and Alex interaction. The fact it broke Alex so much says it all."
5,uj57pv_00006,"I'm starting to wonder if the secret solo task for this given season will be revealed to have been given to Bridget Christie, that it was given by the Taskmaster himself and it was ""Break Alex Horne's Spirit, To Complete Annihilation"". Bridget feels like if Katherine Parkinson was an actual extra terrestrial alien."
6,uj57pv_00007,OT but the banter TM and Little Alex Horne have - what episode does Alex say he’s done his Will and left his jeans to Steven Gerrard? Could have sworn I’ve seen that. Unless it was a vivid dream. But I’ve binged all four episodes again today and it wasn’t any of the banter sections.
7,uj57pv_00008,"Only just got around to watching this episode, and I’m continued to be absolutely fascinated by this series. The tasks are simple but clever, the contestants are all so sympathetic, Alex and Greg are on an absolute roll (“Get your *** hands off of me!”)."
8,uj57pv_00009,"Guess Shoe? was brilliant and a quintessential task of this series since it was the perfect showcase for everyone's personalities. Bridget being confused and aggravating Alex, Judi complaining and bullshitting her way through it, Chris Ramsey having just the best time with it, Sophie getting increasingly exasperated and Ardal fucking it up royally yet still succeeding in the end. Likewise, the 'best stag minute' was the perfect team exercise to display everyone's strengths and oddball mentality. Just a standout episode in every way. I loved that the flag task had the classic secret hidden underneath the desk! I miss whenever there is a ""hack"" to win the task. The studio task was fun, but over much too soon. I love that Ardal fell as soon as his last figure fell. And I know I say this every episode, but I truly have the hots for Bridget Christie."
9,uj57pv_00010,“aLl ThE iNfOrMaTiOn Is On ThE tAsK.” You can tell Chris is a genuine fan.
10,uj57pv_00011,"Greg telling Alex ""Get your fucking hand off me"" is one of the funniest ad-libs in the history of the show. Clearly caught Alex completely off-guard. This will go down as one of the best episodes ever."
11,uj57pv_00012,"""It doesn't remember me"". INCREDIBLE line from Ardal."
12,uj57pv_00013,“A fox skulks around the suburbs like a jazz drummer trying to score heroin” goes straight into the Taskmaster quotes Hall of Fame!
13,uj57pv_00014,"""Sister Queen, don't do it!"" is absolutely another for the quote book"
14,uj57pv_00015,"I am predominantly here for one thing, and that is Ardal O'Hanlon shithousery"
15,uj57pv_00016,"""Get your fucking hand off me"" and ""Just eat your fucking worm"" are definitely future ""what are your favourite TM quotes"" thread comments"
16,uj57pv_00017,Ardal keeping up the comments in the studio knowing his is shit is so good
17,uj57pv_00018,“And an extra K because we got something slightly wrong.”
18,uj57pv_00019,Sophie: supposed to be acting exasperated Also Sophie: actually getting exasperated
19,uj57pv_00020,“Will Taskmaster be happy?” 😭😭😭😭
20,uj57pv_00021,the delivery of ardal saying the memory foam mattress doesn’t remember him made me hysterical
21,uj57pv_00022,I love how character-breakingly exasperated Alex gets with Bridget. 🤣
22,uj57pv_00023,"Sister Queen, don't do it!"
23,uj57pv_00024,“What he’s done.” Alex is getting SNARKY.
24,uj57pv_00025,"Why do I feel so proud of ardal, genuinely so excited for him"
25,uj57pv_00026,This is shaping up to be the best series of all time. They’re all insane.
26,uj57pv_00027,Sophie's death stare 👀👀👀👀👀
27,uj57pv_00028,Cant believe Ardal actually won an episode I’m so happy
28,uj57pv_00029,"Greg and Alex going geordie ""no way!"" was so cute"
29,uj57pv_00030,This episode was genuinely one of the best episodes in a very long time.
30,uj57pv_00031,"In terms of prize tasks, I think this is the best series for the case. It's not because they're the best prizes, but rather because of how good they all are at bull-shitting their way to entertainment through describing their really shitty prizes to Greg. ""What can it do? Everything yours can do, and it's a trampoline"" made me DIE!"
31,uj57pv_00032,"Chris just has one of best attitudes about the show, honestly. Obviously pretty competent and clearly competitive but it just warms my heart to see how he looks genuinely happy when everyone else does well at anything too."
32,uj57pv_00033,Has there ever been a more tragic sight than Ardal's little face when he learned he'd picked the wrong shoe?
33,uj57pv_00034,"So last season they proposed to Alex, this season he had a stag do. Wedding in season 14?"
34,uj57pv_00035,“For what I know ardal has done” I’m dying
35,uj57pv_00036,"Found Bridget quite attractive before this series, but now seeing how she annoys Alex? Absolute diamond."
36,uj57pv_00037,“… sister queen” SOPHIE 😂
37,uj57pv_00038,"The two thought processes. The girls arguing over whether men get twerked on or go to book clubs for stag dos, and the men immediately trying to decide how best to embarrass him."
38,uj57pv_00039,All it took was 4 episodes of Bridget to break Alex
39,uj57pv_00040,"Not enough people are talking about “Don’t fucking touch me.” I would rank that up with “just open the box, you pussy.” For out of nowhere, entirely unwarranted verbal assaults. I think everyone corpsed at that point, even Greg."
40,uj57pv_00041,I love how there’s not just one backstabber this series. They’re all out for each other’s blood.
41,uj57pv_00042,"Ardal has come out with some absolute classic lines already. The memory foam one killed me. I'd forgotten quite how good he is as a pure comedian, and not just a comic actor."
42,uj57pv_00043,I’m glad they are sticking with “the Knappett”.
43,uj57pv_00044,I loved Ardal sticking his leg out at the end.
44,uj57pv_00045,Ardal calling Alex “Horny”
45,uj57pv_00046,Ardals shithousery is golden.
46,uj57pv_00047,Omg I think I have a stitch. Bridget Christy is permanently off her face but just from her own internal brain chemistry I think. Eat your fucking worm. I nearly died. Oik
47,uj57pv_00048,The extra stag point is all that separates them.
48,uj57pv_00049,"Last episode two people called Alex ""Daddy"" and now two people have already called Greg their father."
49,uj57pv_00050,Sophie hurling Alex's shoes out the window is a mood
50,uj57pv_00051,"This episode very succinctly summed up the entire show. Alex's motivation to create the show in the first place: Ardalo: I mean, humiliation is the main part of this. How to complete the tasks properly: Chris: All of the information was on the task. 👉👉 And the cheat code to winning them: Bridget: Well then, it's very simple, isn't it? Suck up to you and you win. TM: Yeah. It's not rocket science."
51,uj57pv_00052,"I have thought every episode that I could not possibly get more gay for Sophie and she proves me wrong Judi Love is already one of the all time TM greats in my book. ""Sister queen don't do it"" is a hall of fame moment for me"
52,uj57pv_00053,Ardal bashing other’s attempts and then doing the worst himself is something I’m never gonna get tired of. I also like to think for the shoe task they knew exactly what to get each contestants to do after asking the question.
53,uj57pv_00054,"Wind is God, friendship is truth—and croissants is croissants"
54,uj57pv_00055,"My mum said she'd go to bed at the first ad-break because she was too tired, but ended up on the edge of her seat and gasping at the live task. That's the power of TM."
55,uj57pv_00056,imagine if you were flicking through TV not knowing what to watch and you came across TM the precise moment they were all spooning milk at each other
56,uj57pv_00057,"Another great episode, fun all around and I was smiling all the time but god I love Chris Ramsey, always smiling, always excited, always supportive. Also I'm really glad Ardal won, I was rooting for him haha. p.s. The still image with the single shoe hanging from the ceiling and Sophie's murderous stare, I'll have nightmares for months to come lol"
57,uj57pv_00058,Alex pointing out Ardal sniping the others despite his own performance.
58,uj57pv_00059,"""All the information was on the task."" Love it."
59,uj57pv_00060,"i adore sophie duker, especially as a taskmaster contestant i knew of her from frankie boyle's new world order, so i knew she was clever and funny, but i didn't really have any idea how she'd be on taskmaster - but she's one of my favourites, i fucking love how she's so calm but just covering this thin veneer of absolute chaos, which we really saw in the shoe who/guess shoe task: the argument about what constitutes a heel asking for his shoes just to hurl them out the window and the stare she levelled at alex when he commented on her level of exasperation was absolutely chilling and that's not to mention her incredible makeup/outfits/hair, i've loved every studio look!"
60,uj57pv_00061,Chris Ramsey is a lovely precious golden retriever man and I love him. I love them all in honesty but Chris during that last task was so precious
61,uj57pv_00062,THE KNAPPETT
62,uj57pv_00063,Guess Who with shoes. Shoe Who.
63,uj57pv_00064,"“Sister, queen, don’t do it” I corpsed"
64,uj57pv_00065,Cemented as my favourite series now. So many laugh out loud moments. Horny. The bed doesn't remember Ardal. Bridget's 4000 questions. Judy trying to sell a duvet. Sophie getting increasingly exasperated Love
65,uj57pv_00066,“NO JUDI.”
66,uj57pv_00067,Was that a stag do or some weird pagan ritual?
67,uj57pv_00068,Sister Queen Don’t do It!
68,uj57pv_00069,The girls stag do was absolute carnage
69,uj57pv_00070,"Judi, Ardal and Bridget are all delightfully unhinged in such different ways from each other."
70,uj57pv_00071,He put his foot out of the duvet. 🤣
71,uj57pv_00072,"The ""no wayyyyyy"" is ending me."
72,uj57pv_00073,The tire roll is such a great live task. Glad to see Ardal have a rare success and take out Chris. Plus it's so rare for the live round to completely change the leaderboard.
73,uj57pv_00074,"This is the first Taskmaster series I have watched and I'm absolutely loving it, Greg's ""Get your fucking hand off me"" was just incredible lmao"
74,uj57pv_00075,"Alternate episode titles: ""Elvis' Funeral"" ""Pour Flour On Him"" ""Milk Balling"" ""Meow."" ""Wind Is God"""
75,uj57pv_00076,Chris is obviously a taskmaster fan and I love it
76,uj57pv_00077,“Dad.” “Papa.” This episode is feeding the Greg as a father figure to the contestants narrative and I love it.
77,uj57pv_00078,Ardal is so excited to win its adorable
78,uj57pv_00079,"""When we separate someone, they've either done very well, or very very badly."" – Greg Davies"
79,uj57pv_00080,ARDAL WON AN EPISODE! I am giddy!
80,uj57pv_00081,I can’t believe Ardal tied after that shoe task.
81,uj57pv_00082,ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE.
82,uj57pv_00083,Was the funeral system the best system? XD
83,uj57pv_00084,"Sister Queen, don't do it!"
84,uj57pv_00085,"I felt genuine joy for Ardal winning, he’s such a pure soul I love him."
85,uj57pv_00086,This already has the potential to be one of the best series of all time. I love Chris's infectious enthusiasm. Judy's semi convincing arguments for everything that she does that is rubbish really makes me smile too.
86,uj57pv_00087,This is one of the few shows I am glad has ad breaks. Gives me a chance to get my breath back from laughing so much. I’m literally in tears and my dog is looking worried.
87,uj57pv_00088,"God damned, am I the only one to be giddy about the Columbo reference? :D Somehow that suited Bridget to a tee! Also, was Chris' ""No way!"" chosen just because of his accent? Ok, just one more thing... This is shaping to be my top 2 or top 3 series!"
88,uj57pv_00089,Ardal on memory foam mattresses might be my favourite ever line from the show. This is also my favourite season so far. Everyone is hilarious.
89,uj57pv_00090,Ardal sitting in the window looking like he's ready to end it all
90,uj57pv_00091,Ardal calling Greg TM again
91,uj57pv_00092,"""Get your fucking hand off me!"""
92,uj57pv_00093,"I really thought each flags colors were going to spell out a different word for the speech. I would've wasted so much time trying to unscramble letters if I hadn't gone for red first Also, Ardal doesn't get much sleep because his mattress doesn't remember him! NO WAY!"
93,uj57pv_00094,ARDAL WON OMGGG FINALLY!!
94,uj57pv_00095,Sophie lobbing Alex's shoes :D
95,uj57pv_00096,"One of the best episodes ever, love me loads more tasks involving Little Alex Horne"
96,uj57pv_00097,This is lining up to be in the top 5 series. There are so many quotable moments already and I'm rooting for every one of these competitors. Also the closest episode in Taskmaster history according to Jack Bernhardt
97,uj57pv_00098,All the information is on the task 🤣 what an episode.
98,uj57pv_00099,Bridget casually inventing a new religion
99,uj57pv_00100,Judi actually breaking the live task in anger is a mood
100,uj57pv_00101,"Either this cast know how to do prize tasks, or the prize task categories have been better than any in the past couple of seasons!"
101,uj57pv_00102,Greg looked genuinely apologetic there 😂
102,uj57pv_00103,Everyone pointing at eachother needs to be a gif
103,uj57pv_00104,Chris is such a teachers pet
104,uj57pv_00105,"Judi could have bullshitted, but she decided to just go out and call Greg and arse."
105,uj57pv_00106,"Another ""debajo de la mesa"" situation!"
106,uj57pv_00107,Ardal looks so sad that his memory foam mattress doesn't remember him lol
107,uj57pv_00108,ARDAL WON! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!
108,uj57pv_00109,"Very glad Alex mentioned the best way to find the shoe after that task. I have programmer brain so I was practically screaming ""binary search"" at my screen. And I might be addicted to taskmaster because I immediately thought there was a trick to the flags, didn't think of the ""red flags"" saying but did look at the red because of the exclamation point. Honestly I thought the reward for that was underwhelming, but I suppose when the ""debajo de la mesa"" incident has already happened and you have fans of the show on you don't want to make prior knowledge be a huge advantage. Edit to say that as people have pointed out, the reward is actually essentially an instant win, so it's actually quite great."
109,uj57pv_00110,Judi's disbelieving laughs are on a par with Joe Lycett's lovely smiles 😂
110,uj57pv_00111,“I was stimulated.” 🥵🥵🥵
111,uj57pv_00112,"Just at the start of the episode. My best ""night time thing"" would be 'the sense of relief when you realize you never have to go to a nightclub again'."
112,uj57pv_00113,"I somehow missed the ""Don’t fucking touch me"" moment??????? Anybody got a timestamp? Or remember at least roughly where in the episode it was."
113,uj57pv_00114,Eat yer fucking worm!
114,uj57pv_00115,His little hop
115,uj57pv_00116,I’d like a gif of Chris doing finger guns at Greg
116,uj57pv_00117,Ardal casually DESTROYING all foxes.
117,uj57pv_00118,Congratulations people who said to look under the desk! Though it wouldn't have helped them much.
118,uj57pv_00119,The Knappett is a fantastic callback!
0,uo90gu_00001,I keep rewinding to 17:00-17:45 to hear Sophie's laugh.
1,uo90gu_00002,"Please can someone find that clip of Bridget Christie laying in the driveway bashing a metal spatula against a cooking pot, it perfectly encapsulates the chaos and the psychic damage these contestants take from the show XDDD"
2,uo90gu_00003,"Adding water was my first thought as well! Yay Ardal! I did think about it in a different way, though. What I considered was finding a ruler, calculating the volume of water missing, then filling up the small tank up to the right height, then pouring that small tank in xD"
3,uo90gu_00004,I was expecting the trick to the tank task was that the volume required was going to be the same as the smaller tank
4,uo90gu_00005,
5,uo90gu_00006,Absolutely loved that cheeky little devil Ardal adding water in the tank task.
6,uo90gu_00007,Bridget wandering forlornly banging a saucepan with a spoon then falling over has real 2022 post-pandemic malaise about it.
7,uo90gu_00008,ardel you smooth talker “i think you’re first among women” 😂
8,uo90gu_00009,The editing on the high five task was just amazing
9,uo90gu_00010,"Really happy that 'Alex is irritated by Bridget' is a recurring bit. Tonight's moment of genuine agitation: Bridget declaring she's sick of going into the bubble, and Alex's exasperated 'me too!'"
10,uo90gu_00011,I can’t believe Ardal has now won two episodes when Sophie hasn’t won any.
11,uo90gu_00012,Bridget is like some kind of forest spirit trying to live among humans
12,uo90gu_00013,"I love that Judi always looks so inconvenienced by the tasks. She’s like, I have better things to do, but I suppose I’ll do you a favour and do this shit."
13,uo90gu_00014,WITHOUT MOVING THE BOWLS.
14,uo90gu_00015,The task: No fish tanks may leave this room. Bridget: No FiSh TaNkS mAy LeAvE tHiS rOoM.
15,uo90gu_00016,“you’re rude and not funny either” 💀
16,uo90gu_00017,Quantity of water is a genius item
17,uo90gu_00018,I want Ardal looking lovingly at the Taskmaster as a gif
18,uo90gu_00019,the “NO WAY” in the title sequence hits extra hard now after we knew where it came from last week
19,uo90gu_00020,"I was really stoked at first for what I believe would've been the precedent of having all 5 contestants together at once on a location. that ""magic of television"" trickery was fantastic"
20,uo90gu_00021,Judi IMMEDIATELY selling out (incorrectly) her team mates to claim victory at all costs. Legends only behaviour.
21,uo90gu_00022,"Bridget, curled up in the fetal position, banging her little pot is me currently in uni exam season."
22,uo90gu_00023,"""For someone who's struggling, they look like very expensive biscuits."" Nice to see Ardal wait until his attempt has been shown before torpedoing someone else for a change."
23,uo90gu_00024,THAT KIMONO LOOKS SO COOL OH MY WORD that should 100% be the official attire of the Taskmaster
24,uo90gu_00025,“BEAT THAT ANNEKA RICE.”
25,uo90gu_00026,Oh my god ardal’s loving look
26,uo90gu_00027,"Ardal is as smooth as he is a shit talker, judi looked very pleased with herself!"
27,uo90gu_00028,…is Bridget okay
28,uo90gu_00029,The pointing at each other is hilarious
29,uo90gu_00030,I think Ardal’s proved he’s willing to sacrifice friends for a win this series.
30,uo90gu_00031,Alex getting annoyed with Bridget again I see!
31,uo90gu_00032,I now call this show Shithousing with Ardal O'Hanlon
32,uo90gu_00033,I cant believe this task with high fives is genuinely the most tense thing ive watched on tv for a year
33,uo90gu_00034,Ardal growling into a boom mic and trying to chase Alex Horne…… I think that’s enough ammunition to have him put into a retirement home.
34,uo90gu_00035,Aw Greg looked so pleased with himself in the kimono
35,uo90gu_00036,Ardal wearing a nurse suit is something I never knew I wanted
36,uo90gu_00037,Absolutely Health and Safety nightmare here: man six-feet up a wobbly ladder leaning into a prickly tree whilst carrying unwieldy cuddly toys. (I would genuinely love to read the Workplace Safety Assessments and Incident Reports this show has to submit)
37,uo90gu_00038,So does everyone have a huge crush on Sophie Duker or is it just me?
38,uo90gu_00039,"I really love the two-part tasks where the contestants end up screwing themselves over. I was so proud of Bridget for keeping that key in her boot. I laughed so hard at the part where Judi called Ardal out for saying she would screw up the task and be the first to high-five Alex, and he deflects by saying, ""Well, I think you're first amongst...women,"" and she makes that priceless reaction. And then it turns out she was the first one to do it! So after this episode, Bridget appears to have edged Chris out of first place, right? Who saw that one coming?"
39,uo90gu_00040,"If only Bridget was quick, that would have been really quick."
40,uo90gu_00041,"They tricked us, thought it was everyone together for a non live task, kinda hope they do that in future"
41,uo90gu_00042,"Ardal wears the face of a sweet dad but is actually a stone cold snake, and I love that for him."
42,uo90gu_00043,We’ve seen from the very first episode that that is a sacrifice Ardal is willing to make.
43,uo90gu_00044,Bridget and Alex are THE duo
44,uo90gu_00045,Ardal winning the series with all the needling would be fantastic
45,uo90gu_00046,Retreving the key will almost certainly come in the middle of another task i think
46,uo90gu_00047,Ardalo in the red leather jacket and greg in the kimono for the final episode please!
47,uo90gu_00048,I can't think of another two-part task where someone has set themselves up so perfectly in the first part and failed so spectacularly in the second.
48,uo90gu_00049,ardal chasing alex while making bear noises is my new favourite thing lmao
49,uo90gu_00050,"Sophie continues to smash the competition in ""best dressed competitor"" category. Which is all the more impressive considering she doesn't have a wardrobe."
50,uo90gu_00051,"The intro is so much funnier now that Im aware of the ""No Way"""
51,uo90gu_00052,Alan Davies' wow monster would have been great here
52,uo90gu_00053,Bridget could have done so well at this one if she wasn't drunk 😂
53,uo90gu_00054,I dont think I’ve ever seen Alex more frustrated with any other contestant than he is with Bridget this series. You can tell that last task really broke the both of them lol “STOP talking to the camera people!”
54,uo90gu_00055,I PUT IT TO YOU
55,uo90gu_00056,They cut away just as Greg started swooping!
56,uo90gu_00057,All of them together? This is like when the five Doctor Whos met
57,uo90gu_00058,Bridget is amazing but it baffles me how she's leading the series compared to Chris
58,uo90gu_00059,Wasn’t a fan of Judi Love before this series. But I was absolutely wrong. She is hilarious.
59,uo90gu_00060,"Is it me, or was Ardal's water solution smarter than Alex's?"
60,uo90gu_00061,bridget is a disaster and i love her
61,uo90gu_00062,Greg running off wearing the kimono 💀
62,uo90gu_00063,"Just listened to the podcast, apparently Judi was doing/training for strictly while she was doing TM so she was physically exhausted. That explains why she seems so annoyed in the live tasks when she has to do anything lol"
63,uo90gu_00064,Sophie sounds genuinely on the verge of tears.
64,uo90gu_00065,Ardal chasing Alex is my favourite
65,uo90gu_00066,“-‘you must stare loving at the Tasmaster-‘ I’m not doing that!” She straight up murdered Greg.
66,uo90gu_00067,Ardal is very good at being a worm I’m sure he’ll be good at this
67,uo90gu_00068,Anneka's up for it!
68,uo90gu_00069,Greg looks amazing in that kimono.
69,uo90gu_00070,"That is one heck of a turnaround for Ardal points-wise, on top of him being absolutely adorable (especially the nurse outfit <3). Also, Bridget is one big giant mood."
70,uo90gu_00071,Latest ever title?
71,uo90gu_00072,"Ardal masterclass. First with the high-fiveing multiple times, and then with adding water into the tank."
72,uo90gu_00073,Everything Ardal does delights me.
73,uo90gu_00074,"Shout out to the creators of the tasks for keeping it innovative and challenging. They are 13 seasons in, more than a hundred episodes and these were some dang creative tasks! That key hiding one had everyone split between 'they are going to have to find that key for the next task' and 'Alex is going to have to pick through someone's poop'. The water and brick task was genius - I assume that was a statue of Archimedes? Bridget's meltdown holding a bag of stuffed animals? Sophie's underrated line: ""I'm a millenial I had to pay for a lot of brunches."" Ardal's squeaky jacket . . . just a great episode through and through. I also have the feeling that there are some multi-episode threads going on that I can't quite pick out."
74,uo90gu_00075,“All the information’s on the task.” “There’s no more information.”
75,uo90gu_00076,God save Ardal if he ever has to embark upon a quest and is faced with an Egyptian sphinx who will only let him pass if he has to solve a logic puzzle.
76,uo90gu_00077,alex: did you all enjoy that? everyone but ardel: no
77,uo90gu_00078,"I now want them to set up a two part task like ""when the alarm sounds you must put on the jumpsuit"" or something like that and pay it off in studio. Bridget has such a different relationship with Alex than any other contestant. I initially thought that the high five task would have been better if they were all solo and not in the two groups but it played out brilliantly with them having each other to talk to. How is ""Pandas in my [censored]"" not the episode title?"
78,uo90gu_00079,"I feel like Alex is laughing a lot more this season, is it just me?"
79,uo90gu_00080,The phone answering task - that's my favorite kind of task. Just pure chaos and only for entertainment's sake. There's no real strategy or clever way to win. And at no point is it clear to the audience who's winning. It's really just for a fun mess to watch.
80,uo90gu_00081,I hope someone has Rhod hidden in their wardrobe
81,uo90gu_00082,"This is the second episode in the row Ardal has won and that too with a great margin. I know he's 2nd last right now, but if he continues like this, pretty sure he can snatch the series away from Chris and Bridgette. P.S. Love Ardal's cute ""having a little chuckle"" and flirty smile to Greg. Reminded me of Doc Brown and Fred. Edit: Grammar"
82,uo90gu_00083,Sophie was cheated out of 5 points: the fact that they weren't scored for making the keys difficult but not impossible to retrieve is the biggest injustice since Potatogate IMO
83,uo90gu_00084,I'm amazed with how they made such a simple task so entertaining. Fantastic editing as always.
84,uo90gu_00085,Ardalo is the Chris Ramsey early series 13 of mid series 13 :-O
85,uo90gu_00086,Ardal is so fucking good
86,uo90gu_00087,
87,uo90gu_00088,Greg running away at the end there like MY PEOPLE NEED ME
88,uo90gu_00089,All 4 once again ruining the credits sequence by only showing 1/8th of the picture
89,uo90gu_00090,Having everyone back close together in the studio with an audience really has added back in that last missing element of this show's greatness.
90,uo90gu_00091,"To be honest Bridget was right, it was exciting"
91,uo90gu_00092,"Bridgette read the task, except not really."
92,uo90gu_00093,This task feels like my brain when I’m in the middle of a break down.
93,uo90gu_00094,I think we need to strongly reassess who the series whipping boy will be.
94,uo90gu_00095,"Beginning to feel like Ardal is the underdog for this series. I hope he wins the whole lot, so funny."
95,uo90gu_00096,Strong episode. Key task was gold. Live task might be the weakest of the season so far.
96,uo90gu_00097,high five him three times immediately
97,uo90gu_00098,Just putting it out there: Judi Love would win the Hunger Games.
98,uo90gu_00099,Judi has had a proper strop for pretty much every live task
99,uo90gu_00100,"What an amazing episode. I loved the two parter and the studio task had me in tears. I'm actually surprised how Ardal is doing, after the first episode I would have never predicted that he could ever win an episode by 8 points in the lead. It's always great when one of Gregs actual friends is on, first the dance (or what ever that was with Bridget) in the last episode and now the kimono discussion. Just a great line up, brilliant series"
100,uo90gu_00101,If he actually does wears it for the final I will be so happy
101,uo90gu_00102,"Another ""without moving the fishbowls"" situation!"
102,uo90gu_00103,OH BRIDGET YOU CLEVER LASS
103,uo90gu_00104,Sassy Alex forever ❤️
104,uo90gu_00105,The final task was like a weird book cover for God Emperor of Dune.
105,uo90gu_00106,"Where they showed the bricks was interesting since they very rarely have shown the ""right"" way to do a task. Since no one really paid attention to the little statue they couldn't really insert a close up of it during the task as they have done with other tasks to show that the answer was right under their nose."
106,uo90gu_00107,He fucking called it!!
107,uo90gu_00108,Beat that anneka rice Icon
108,uo90gu_00109,I love you Bridget aha has the easiest key retrieve but just cannot find the phone ahah
109,uo90gu_00110,45:29 Is this the latest time where the episode title was said?
110,uo90gu_00111,"Was hoping someone would've used the patented Paul Sinha technique of ""HELLO!!?!?"" to keep above 50db."
111,uo90gu_00112,"I was thinking during the answer the phone task that if i was doing it I'd break the box. If I got called on it by Alex I'd use his ""All the information is on the task"" line. Since the task never said I couldn't break the box then I'd be fine? Do you think that would hold up?"
112,uo90gu_00113,Ardal is a bit of a clever one tonight
113,uo90gu_00114,I've said it once and I'll say it again. I would happily die for Ardal.
114,uo90gu_00115,I love Bridget so much.
115,uo90gu_00116,"I reckon they weren’t monitoring the sound level very closely, was more entertaining to not fail them for it"
116,uo90gu_00117,Ardal obliterated everyone this week
117,uo90gu_00118,"My thoughts on the episode (sorry this turned out really long): Prize Task: Okay prize task, surprised so many went with clothes, thought there might be something else like with Sophie's biscuits. Really wasn't surprised Bridget had a kimono though. Task 0.5: Hiding the key. Happy to see a formula shake up, as I think it keeps the show fresh. New Zealand Taskmaster were great at this eg. Outlandish costume (s1, ep8), burner phone (s2, ep6), sabotage (s2, ep8). It's kind of a shame that you didn't need to make it difficult and didn't get any points for that part of this task. Task 1: Interesting concept that it was a team task but not a team task. I thought Sophie and Bridget were a bit silly not to right after Judi as they would be sure they could get 2nd & 3rd. Bridget was especially crazy to wait as she just ensured herself last. I really think the scores were odd as it wasn't explained in the task how many points 2nd & penultimate place would get, so Ardal & Chris got 4 points which seemed a lot. Plus Ardal was technically last in the time so Greg was breaking the rules a bit. Task 2: Saying 'if any water leaves the fish tank you are disqualified' was a bit ridiculous as there was water on both Ardal and Judi's fingers in their attempts, and even on Alex in his 'correct answer', so technically like Chris, Bridget and Sophie they should have all failed. Would've been cool to see the rest of Bridget & Sophie's attempts even though they were disqualified, especially how they abruptly cut away from Sophie in the studio, I sense a fair bit more cut there. If Alex's banter and Greg's intro were shorter we could've seen what happened. Task 3: Again with the editing, it was never explained whether the contestants made a noise over 50 db for over 50% of the task, Alex could've easily mentioned it. However the pay off with the box needing the key was good. Also surprised Greg didn't point out how irritated Alex got at Bridget in this one, as he was clearly pissed off: ""Stop talking to the camera people."" and ""Me too."" Live Task: So I liked the concept, but felt like it needed polish. Think the always looking at Greg is getting a bit overused, as it meant the screaming 5 seconds wasn't enforced that well (eg Ardal only did a quick shout). Again felt like another bit was cut out, as the scores weren't that well explained, like did Chris get points or not because he didn't pop out 3 red balls. Overall I think this episode put in all the most complicated tasks together which meant certain aspects like scoring never got explained well and editing felt a bit jumpy. Fortunately the great studio banter helped alleviate this. Sorry for such a long (and probably irritating) analysis."
118,uo90gu_00119,"Where did Judi find the trolley bag to carry all her stuffed animals? Episode title: Beat That, Anneka Rice."
119,uo90gu_00120,"Why did Bridget do that? She's guaranteed to be last, unless someone didn't high-5 Alex at all"
120,uo90gu_00121,"I’m going to be honest, i’m proud of ardal!"
121,uo90gu_00122,I feel like i need that Bridget clip as a gif. But it's a shame gifs don't have sound
122,uo90gu_00123,Volume of the small tank is exactly what was missing?
123,uo90gu_00124,Key task was great
124,uo90gu_00125,I put it back to you
125,uo90gu_00126,haha Alex looking incredibly worried in the background of Ardal on the ladder.
126,uo90gu_00127,I feel like this was the most chaotic episode I’ve ever seen. Especially that live task…
127,uo90gu_00128,It was the safest bet in the world to say Judi hi fived first. She just wants to get things over with
128,uo90gu_00129,They should have given points for hiding the keys.
129,uo90gu_00130,"After the boys went on the high five task, I was thinking it must be a pretty good advantage to be the task reader so that you can read the whole list of rules instead of just hearing them (since Chris read the task and understood it but Ardal didn't). Then Bridget read the task and Sophie was the only one who understood. Plus I suppose you could just pick up the task and re-read it. Ardal really got bailed out on that one. He gave himself an unnecessarily high chance of being DQ'd by going so many times, but since Judi and Bridget understood the task even less than him, he got 4 points out of it. For the key hiding task, I felt pretty strongly that it was going to be a two-parter, which creates a dilemma. Even if you knew it would be two parts, you would want a good hiding spot in case the parts are both scored. It didn't end up being scored, but I think Bridget struck the best combination of completing the first part well but still setting herself up for success in the second part (even if she flubbed it). Overall, quite a good episode. I think last week's was a little better in large part because this live task was underwhelming. But the key task was classic TM and the high five task was very exciting."
130,uo90gu_00131,"fun episode but man it feels like such a flip, it's the first episode where ardal seems to actually fully know what show he is in when doing the pre-recorded tasks, he's been a delight and a bit of a snake in the live tasks and prize tasks, but I did initially think he was going to end up being the ditz of the series. But the tank task and even the high five task show he's thinking more about the tasks now (as high fiving multiple times was arguably the smart play even if he stumbled into it by accident) but man does Sophie feel a lot more tired this episode then previous ones? There was a big deflation of energy from the younger players this episode, Sophie by far the most, but Judi and Chris were not that far behind her. Chris was way more chipper in the first few episodes and sophie was non existent this episode. Didnt help that both her and Bridget were disqualified from the tank task and it didnt do the usual show them the full way through and then tell them after that they broke the rules."
131,uo90gu_00132,Ardal was right lmaoo
132,uo90gu_00133,"""one big ball by your leg"" could have been the episode title"
133,uo90gu_00134,Judi's shady glance to the side as she admitted she did NOT understand the task was a beautiful moment.
134,uo90gu_00135,This fish tank task is proper old school classic Taskmaster!
135,uo90gu_00136,Bridget was in the best position to win that task but fucked it. If only they got points for retrieving the key the quickest.
136,uo90gu_00137,judi yet again has no idea what’s going on 😂 i love her
137,uo90gu_00138,They seem absolutely exhausted
138,uo90gu_00139,All of them together?! Madness
139,uo90gu_00140,"To me, Ardal is forever young as Father Dougal, I can’t get over him being the older one here!"
140,uo90gu_00141,"Oh. I mean, she didn’t win anyway, but Bridget didn’t even place!"
141,uo90gu_00142,I have such a big crush on Sophie
142,uo90gu_00143,"Jesus, first logic puzzles, now Archimedes' Principle of water displacement. This lot of eejits are DOOMED."
143,uo90gu_00144,Displacement and decibel levels are Alex's two favourite science-related topics.
144,uo90gu_00145,Could Ardal win the series? Probably not but i wonder
145,uo90gu_00146,Bridget’s a bit confused this task.
146,uo90gu_00147,"It seems strange that they weren't penalised if they didn't put the key in a very difficult to reach place. Bridget's didn't really matter in the end, but for example Ardel's was a lot easier to reach than Sophie's"
147,uo90gu_00148,"I've always wanted Prof Brian Cox on as a guest for a special episode, because I really hope he would make a tit of himself. But I reckon a scientific approach to the water displacement task could do well. It'd be easy to calculate the volume of water that needs displaced."
148,uo90gu_00149,I think Bridget may be the best contestant that's ever been on taskmaster
149,uo90gu_00150,Ok that was a splendid task. Simple but exciting
150,uo90gu_00151,"- I would've aced the prize task, I've got a plastic box of childhood toys inside my wardrobe. Infinite comedic potential in just listing the hundreds of toys that take up space in the place clothes are supposed to go. - Again, the main issue with two part tasks is that only the second half is scored, but the first is under false pretenses. So, even though the task said ""difficult, but possible to retrieve"", the difficulty of retrieving the key wasn't a factor in the scoring of the task. This means that failing the first half is actually beneficial. - High five task was amazing, both a social experiment and difficult enough to fry the brains of several contestants. The presentation of compositing the two takes was the final touch that made it that much better. And though is an incredibly logic based task, a logically minded person will make the mistake of assuming that others understand the task and act in the ideal manner to win. Because it's about predicting individual personalities and behaviour, the safer thing to do would be to make no assumptions and high five at 5 minutes exactly. - Obviously we're backseat gaming and think with benefit of hindsight we would get all the trick answers. But I'm sad no one got this one. The statue was literally the man who discovered displacement as a mathematical concept, and the statue was placed prominently. If you notice the statue and go ""why is that here"", the first place you check is the bottom, the only side you can hide something on. - The second half of the task was diminished by how similar the answers to the first half were. Because everyone just threw it up a tree, the plushies added little obstacle to retrieving the key the second time. - The live task was so chaotic that Alex couldn't enforce all the rules simultaneously, which therefore broke them. ""Stare lovingly at the taskmaster"" was supposed to counter looking down for the right coloured balls, but Alex got distracted enforcing shouting and dancing, and therefore people got away with cheating the task."
151,uo90gu_00152,Would you have broken the box? I was thinking that as it wasn't written in the task they didn't really need to obey it.
152,uo90gu_00153,Can't believe Alex said that about nurses
153,uo90gu_00154,Have we ever had a non studio task with all five contestants present??
154,uo90gu_00155,Bridget either not understanding the high five task or big braining it
155,uo90gu_00156,Man I've got such a crush on Bridget. Her outfit is just ✨perfect✨
156,uo90gu_00157,"Ardal might actually win another episode tonight, very unexpected considering his performance at the start of the series lol"
157,uo90gu_00158,We all knew that image was going to end the episode.
158,uo90gu_00159,The high five task is my favourite task in this series by miles
159,uo90gu_00160,Sophie’s boots!!
160,uo90gu_00161,That is so brilliantly planned by Alex!
161,uo90gu_00162,THE KEY
162,uo90gu_00163,"Realizing that a person was allowed to high five multiple times (as Ardal did), what am I missing that someone just shouldn't have immediately approached Alex and smacked him three straight times? I didn't fully understand until the task was done that it was indeed the third fastest in 10 minutes out of all 5 people to high five him, so why wouldn't a person just right off the bat do it multiple times so that they definitely filled in as ""third place"". Would they also having been ""first"" have then cancelled that totally out?"
163,uo90gu_00164,I really do want to know the story of Chris dunking bibles in water…
164,uo90gu_00165,Each of them is going to have to find another contestants keys
165,uo90gu_00166,Can I just put on record that Judi Love is my new icon?
166,uo90gu_00167,So Anneka Rice for New year’s taskmaster?
167,uo90gu_00168,This is honestly the best episode of taskmaster ever
168,uo90gu_00169,That red leather jacket is fly.
169,uo90gu_00170,My husband just suggested putting books in the fish tank and I think it may be divorce time now.
170,uo90gu_00171,My husband suspects if you put the small fish tank on the plinth in the big one it will raise the water level to the edge and then you can put any 5 items in it to complete the task.
171,uo90gu_00172,I'm having a cheese dream
172,uo90gu_00173,I feel like we’re at a zoo
173,uo90gu_00174,No way
174,uo90gu_00175,"I wasn’t at all surprised Bridget had that kimono in her wardrobe, until she claimed it was for Greg!"
175,uo90gu_00176,So are they retrieving the key to gain access to something in a later task? Or are they going to be judged on how long it takes someone else to retrieve their key?
176,uo90gu_00177,i love that judi still doesn’t understand the task
177,uo90gu_00178,"that ""yeah"" from Sophie was iconic"
178,uo90gu_00179,Judi went first!
179,uo90gu_00180,I understood the task but I’m not sure I understand the scoring of it…
180,uo90gu_00181,CHRIS WAS SO CLOSE!!!
181,uo90gu_00182,I only realised while watching that that a very viable method (throughout many other tasks too) is to put in minimum effort and rely on other people being disqualified for more points.
182,uo90gu_00183,"Shout for ten seconds, listen for slightly less than ten seconds. Repeat. Much better chance than shouting the whole time!"
183,uo90gu_00184,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT
184,uo90gu_00185,"Obviously it's difficult to tell given we didn't see anything close to the full time of the task for each contestant, but it didn't seem like they were making noise for 50% of the time."
185,uo90gu_00186,"The worst final task, but my favourite overall episode of the current series so far. The high-five task was brilliant. Ardal O'Hanlon is great anyway, but I especially love his Dougal-isms."
186,uo90gu_00187,calling it: they definitely have to retrieve someone else's key
187,uo90gu_00188,ALL OF THEM TOGETHER?
188,uo90gu_00189,Oh? A non live task involving all of them? I haven’t seen this happen before.
189,uo90gu_00190,Oh this high five task is a magnificent mind game!
190,uo90gu_00191,Another showdown between Chris and Sophie!!
191,uo90gu_00192,God I love Judi
192,uo90gu_00193,I'm suspecting that small statue is a clue...
193,uo90gu_00194,Is Ardal on for 2 in a row here?!
194,uo90gu_00195,THE SECOND PART AHA!
195,uo90gu_00196,The final task will be a classic
196,uo90gu_00197,Surely Ardal getting water onto his hand and then flicking it when he dunked his items means a DQ. Alex put his hand in the tank too but I figured this was just to speed things up.
197,uo90gu_00198,"There's going to be a part 2 to this which is ""retrieve the key"", isn't there? Lol. That's my immediate thought."
198,uo90gu_00199,Expecting part 2 to be retrieving the item
199,uo90gu_00200,judi love bullshitting as usual lmao
200,uo90gu_00201,Big reminder of the money task from series 7. How many are going to be disqualified by being overzealous?
201,uo90gu_00202,"Let me guess, their tanks left the room"
202,uo90gu_00203,Eureka!
203,uo90gu_00204,… I think I found the second part of the key task. The brilliant bastards!
204,uo90gu_00205,Bridget took her giddy pills
205,uo90gu_00206,Episode title drop!
206,uo90gu_00207,So what would have happened in the high five task if someone just went up and did 3 in a row right at the beginning? Easy win right? The task didn't say you only had one and Ardal was allowed to do multiple. Also no point deductions were mentioned so would you also get the points for 2nd?
207,uo90gu_00208,Wasn't the statue used in the water displacement task also the one used several series ago where they had to make some scales give an exact reading? i.e. a little easter egg on how to win the task perhaps.
208,uo90gu_00209,Ardul's started on the shit talking early
209,uo90gu_00210,The key!!!!
210,uo90gu_00211,BWHAHA! THERE'S THE KEY TASK! LOVE IT!
211,uo90gu_00212,I want to see Bridget wear that kimono.
212,uo90gu_00213,Has Greg not had a birthday in 17 years!?
213,uo90gu_00214,Alex is an evil genius!
214,uo90gu_00215,Clever task
215,uo90gu_00216,Is Alex going to have the fake hand on for the entire show?
216,uo90gu_00217,That’s going to go to the slow mo to determine.
217,uo90gu_00218,Big fish tank?! Is that the big fish tank or is there another one?
218,uo90gu_00219,ayyy my hero mention!!
219,uo90gu_00220,Is Bridget not all there? She was acting way too crazy in the phone task
0,utb601_00001,"Isn’t it strange that Judi guessed Quantum and the guy paused for a while and his name ended up being Quentin, she guessed that so early too just randomly."
1,utb601_00002,Every single contestant won a task this episode! Not often that occurs.
2,utb601_00003,Watched a few days late. This is the best episode in awhile. Laughed out loud in the early AM twice.
3,utb601_00004,I think this is one of the best seasons yet. I like how vicious they all are.
4,utb601_00005,They should hire Chris to make up some tasks - I need to see what other tasks the creator of Sausage Mixer has in his brain
5,utb601_00006,"""What kind of dramatic meeting would you like to do?"" ""Tennis Club"" As somebody who's been in a sports club all my life, I felt that."
6,utb601_00007,I never sausage craziness!
7,utb601_00008,Some day I hope to be as strong as the inseam of Greg Davies' trousers
8,utb601_00009,"currently watching it, just saw the sausage cement mixer and jesus that was awesome, couldnt stop laughing. edit: seeing Bridget taking steps XD what a gem this ep is."
9,utb601_00010,"I know I’m a bit late, but two men terrified of their own sausage machine is the pinnacle of humour."
10,utb601_00011,"“Are you a French trapeze artist.” Right, this is why it’s going to take 75 questions."
11,utb601_00012,The slow mo replays of Alex giving it his all while Chris shits himself were hilarious
12,utb601_00013,"‘No you got beaten by everyone’. Even Chris, the most supportive of these lunatics, couldn’t resist a burn there."
13,utb601_00014,“I’m next to my big man.”
14,utb601_00015,Cement Mixer Sausage Catch is SIGNIFICANTLY more terrifying a game than Chris Ramsay anticipated.
15,utb601_00016,Ardal realising as he straddles Linda just how much of a terrifying serial killer he appears is just a truly magical moment.
16,utb601_00017,"“Even though we’ve been working together for a while now, we don’t really know or like each other.” “Pardon?”"
17,utb601_00018,Surprised Greg got his legs like that without ripping his trousers ahahaha
18,utb601_00019,Taskmaster Occupational Health & Safety Report Number 1472. Cause of Death: Impaled through the eye socket with an airborne pedometer propelled by an electric drill
19,utb601_00020,“i don’t mind actually i’m just really happy in life” god i wish that was me
20,utb601_00021,He was standing in a Q on the podium
21,utb601_00022,I love that “Yeah babes” is the universal impression of Judi
22,utb601_00023,"“I’m arresting you for embezzlement. And murder. More importantly, I’m resigning from the club.”"
23,utb601_00024,The fact that Ardal forcefully drowning a mannequin wasn’t the funniest moment of this episode really says something. This season is amazing.
24,utb601_00025,Ardal is so fucking lucky that Greg is the only other person on the face of the planet who finds tea towels calming.
25,utb601_00026,Not a moment’s hesitation from Alex in picking Hugh there!
26,utb601_00027,There's a bit of a love hate thing going on with Alex and Sophie. Alex loves Sophie and Sophie just wants Alex to die.
27,utb601_00028,“I got beaten by someone recording-“ “You know you’ve got beat by everyone?” CHRIST. This whole line up are merciless.
28,utb601_00029,"Relax at Ardul's saloon, where he snaps your neck and humps your corpse"
29,utb601_00030,I guessed that it was Quentin after the look he gave Quantum
30,utb601_00031,"The sausage game made me laugh so hard - crying, couldn't breathe, and gasping. Last time I laughed that hard at a task was the silent cocktail in s10"
31,utb601_00032,"""17 quid each...It's like a normal London bar babes"" She ain't wrong"
32,utb601_00033,The switch between Chris being terrified and Alex fully going for it was incredible lmao
33,utb601_00034,It’s been half an hour and I still don’t understand how Quentin wasn’t the first guess once they got to Q. Or at least ahead of Quiz.
34,utb601_00035,If Greg could sit like Sophie did more easily he might have understood why hers was the most relaxing prize.
35,utb601_00036,"""I got beaten... by someone... recording a number..."" ""No, you got beaten by everyone."""
36,utb601_00037,"“Does your name start with the last 5 letters of the alphabet?” ""No."" “Xavier.”"
37,utb601_00038,Yay at least Sophie gets her ‘body massager’ back
38,utb601_00039,"Bridget with the pedometer is my favourite task in a long time. 15 minutes of pure chaos & confusion, followed by an insane epiphany of lateral thinking"
39,utb601_00040,His face when Judi asked if his name was Quantum lol
40,utb601_00041,The sausage cement mixer game had me absolutely dying. Instant classic of a moment. Yet another banger of an episode in this excellent series.
41,utb601_00042,judi is FUMING that someone outlazied her and i’m so happy
42,utb601_00043,Greg one week: No that’s ridiculous and clearly not the task Greg the next week: Fantastic lateral thinking I love it
43,utb601_00044,Loky is actually the name of Alex’s dog! Just heard that today on the Adam Buxton podcast
44,utb601_00045,"""I don't mind actually, I'm quite happy in life"" is the new ""I had an absolutely lovely day""."
45,utb601_00046,I have never laughed so hard as when Alex asked Bridget to just walk normally... and then she just swung her legs out further.
46,utb601_00047,This might be the best use of slow motion in taskmaster history
47,utb601_00048,Bridget somehow turned one of the worst attempts I’ve seen recently into a win.
48,utb601_00049,"Sophie somehow predicting that Bridget would be the one to kill Alex, albeit she’d probably do it by accident. Also, that spread, though."
49,utb601_00050,"During Judi’s Jeremy Kyle-esque drama, I’d like to point out she has a masters in social work."
50,utb601_00051,"Was there some secret advantage in that clog during the pedometer task? Maybe an inscription of ""under the table"" in Dutch? Bridget managed to somehow get flustered by a task that was essentially ""walk."" She is such a wonderful addition to the cast."
51,utb601_00052,"""rarely have I seen a sausage go from still to accelerating that fast"""
52,utb601_00053,How did it take so many guesses after Q to get Quentin?
53,utb601_00054,FINALLY SOPHIE WINS!!
54,utb601_00055,You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders! Never attach a pedometer to a wheeled remote control rat when points are on the line!
55,utb601_00056,“Which Taskmaster contestant would you raise as your own child?” “Hugh Dennis.” Mine would be Joe Thomas.
56,utb601_00057,Oh my god Greg doing the pose
57,utb601_00058,This season has been fantastic I don't think I have EVER seen Alex get so annoyed so much at one contestant like he has at Bridget this season lol.
58,utb601_00059,"""You haven't taken any normal steps yet!"" (Bridget starts marching around like a lunatic)"
59,utb601_00060,"Between sausage arena and basket ball, Chris Ramsey has a future in game design."
60,utb601_00061,I NEED THE WHOLE UNEDITED THING PLEASE
61,utb601_00062,“I know we haven’t gotten to know each other very well and don’t actually like each other…” “What”
62,utb601_00063,"Pimpernel, Luigi, Quantum."
63,utb601_00064,"Between Chris' Sausage Mixer, Bridget's walk, and Sophie and her power tool pedometer this was a banner day for physical comedy. Ardal would be who you'd cast if the BBC made a show about Bill Belichick, grumpy American football coach."
64,utb601_00065,"Chris' reaction to Ardal's complete failure to ask a question had big ""It didn't occur to him it wouldn't be a person!"" vibes."
65,utb601_00066,I can see fear in Chris’ eyes when that sausage spinner started spinning
66,utb601_00067,It's good to see that Bridget and Greg are reinstating the Ministry of Silly Walks.
67,utb601_00068,"Greg was a bit ruthless this episode. That vibrator (not dildo) deserved 5 points for being the most relaxing thing. Any other day, the tea towel would have been a 1. It was so funny to see Ardal straddling the dummy and holding her head underwater while laughing maniacally. Also loved that he was using Greg & Shoulders shampoo. Chris's cement mixer task was the best just to watch Alex repeatedly getting hit in the face with a bit of sausage. For the pedometer task, I definitely would have employed the ""jerking off"" technique and won it easily. The images of Bridget doing her silly walk while in her gunslinger getup were priceless, as was her reaction to only getting 139 steps. ""If you say it's 139, I'm— you're going to— I'm— I don't mind actually, I'm just happy in life. I don't mind."" The ""have a meeting with yourself"" task was so much fun, even the ones who didn't ""follow"" the task. Sophie's Taskmaster jury was my favorite by far. Also interesting to note that Sophie made not one, but two references to Alex's death this episode. For the live task, Ardal seemed to ask the best question, which was ""does your name begin with a letter after K?"" If they kept eliminating possibilities that way, they would have gotten it in far less than 75 questions."
68,utb601_00069,"Feels a bit like old news, but does anyone else find Sophie unbelievably attractive"
69,utb601_00070,Bridget doing Ardal impressions has officially killed me.
70,utb601_00071,"Sophie reminds me of Acaster so much. ""what I'm thinking of is your death"""
71,utb601_00072,Chris' cement mixer sausage seems like he created his own new task! (I'd get him to be a task consultant!) I honestly had to pause my video so many times during that task because my stomach was physically hurting from laughing at it so much! Can't wait for all the sausage-face-slapping gifs!
72,utb601_00073,I love that Quantum was close.
73,utb601_00074,Ardal coming back into reality as he straddles a mannequin was a highlight of my life and possibly his life
74,utb601_00075,"""have you ever walked?"""
75,utb601_00076,Bridget is never gonna live down her walking...ha ha
76,utb601_00077,"I was sorely wrong about not getting Sophie Duker for the last few episodes—turns out she's as macabre as she drew Greg in that first task. Bridget not knowing how to walk for multiple episodes yet still winning a walking-related task for her lateral thinking is insane(ly cool). If Judi Love hasn't won you over yet (esp. with the dynamic between her and Chris), you need more joy in your life. I agree with Ed: Ardal's tea towel did not deserve 5 points, but he redeemed the funny when he couldn't blurt out a question in 10 seconds."
77,utb601_00078,"“Hi, babes!” Alex’s impression of Judi killed me."
78,utb601_00079,WTF Judi's weird quantum guess was so close!
79,utb601_00080,
80,utb601_00081,"Ardal was robbed on salon, I’ve never seen a cement mixer used in such a vicious fashion"
81,utb601_00082,"Ardal: Linda’s happy. Me: Linda’s dead, Ardal."
82,utb601_00083,Bridget must’ve been employed by the Ministry of Silly Walks at a different point in her life
83,utb601_00084,Someone please get HD stills of both Ardal straddling his hairdressing client while Alex watches through the window and Alex holding one of Greg's legs as he spreads himself in a childbirthing position on his throne.
84,utb601_00085,I don't think I've ever wanted to see the full unedited footage of a task as much as this live task
85,utb601_00086,"Another excellent episode. I wasnt too crazy about the meeting task. It was a tad bland, but the rest of it (especially Chris' sausage game), was pure gold. Back to the meeting task, I do want to say one thing - the editors should be recruited for blockbuster hollywood movies. I know the green grass helped with the keying, but that was some fucking seamless editing. There was a part where Ardal was sat in front of the sunset, just 2 feet away from Ardal, which was obviously filmed at a different time. Were the chairs actually set against a green screen or something? I can't logically process how they did it."
86,utb601_00087,That clip of Chris Ramsey is up there with Richard Herring in the bush looking a bit like Klaus Kinski
87,utb601_00088,When Judi said Quantum and he paused I immediately knew his name would be Quentin LOL
88,utb601_00089,"Is no one talking about how the hair salon mixer is bringing back Sally Phillips vibes? That was such complete comedic madness, I feel like it was robbed at 1 pt... Sausage mixer deserved 5 points by a long shot... I had to pause I was laughing so hard."
89,utb601_00090,GREG & SHOULDERS!
90,utb601_00091,Bridget/Alex and Sophie/Alex are both polar opposite dynamics to Katherine Parkinson/Alex.
91,utb601_00092,Does Bridget need some sort of neurological examination?
92,utb601_00093,Why is Sophie so obsessed with poor Alex’s death today?
93,utb601_00094,😂 I can't believe nobody just walked normally! I checked my app and I did a 22 minute walk and it was 2281 steps. That's without power walking!
94,utb601_00095,"I prefer the cooperative seasons a bit more to the chaotic ones, but this season and S7 are exceptional. The sniping is not out of competitiveness, it’s just a byproduct of the fact that they’re all crazy and I love it."
95,utb601_00096,Bridget’s impression of Ardal is going to restart The Troubles.
96,utb601_00097,“Welcome to the sausage arena.” Definite alternate episode title.
97,utb601_00098,chris has won this episode with this task alone i’m CRYING
98,utb601_00099,“Is your name Pimpernickel?” Jesus H Christ.
99,utb601_00100,My mum was killing herself laughing when Chris's sausage spinner started up and started assaulting poor Alex.
100,utb601_00101,Ok after this episode I’m ready to officially declare that this cast is my favorite of all time.
101,utb601_00102,The cement mixer got up to speed instantly. It provided no opportunity for a reasonable outcome. Some of the best physical comedy I’ve ever seen.
102,utb601_00103,"I wonder how Bridget felt when she's doing the 589 steps task, knowing the pedometer works when you just... walk."
103,utb601_00104,"Just a ridiculously strong episode, so many laugh-out-loud moments. Literally an hour after watching the episode whilst doing something else I remembered Ardal's ""Are you a French trapeze artist?"" and started laughing at the ludicrousness of that question compared to what's being the task."
104,utb601_00105,Ardal mounting that mannequin and giggling like an inept sex dungeon participant who's in way over his head (and Alex also cracking up in the little window in the background) had me dying
105,utb601_00106,“Is your name Quiz?”
106,utb601_00107,I’m concerned that isn’t the first time Ardal has dunked a woman’s head into a cement mixer full of water
107,utb601_00108,YES SOPHIE FINALLY
108,utb601_00109,What an amazing episode. The cement mixer may have snuck its way into the all time best tasks.
109,utb601_00110,"On Quentin’s turning platform you can see it makes a Q. At that moment I immediately guessed his name is probably Quentin because that’s the only Q name I know. Of course, they wouldn’t have been able to see this hint in the studio."
110,utb601_00111,Another episode and already so much laughter. This series is definitely one of if not the best so far. Ardal straddling a mannequin with her head in a cement mixer is something I never thought I'd see. Fantastic!
111,utb601_00112,All those performances gave big GCSE Drama vibes lol
112,utb601_00113,Thank god there was an audience for that live task lol. If it was a series without one it would have been deadening lol
113,utb601_00114,Sausage mixer. Instant classic
114,utb601_00115,"“I don’t like omelettes, orchids. That’s right, I don’t like omelettes or children.”"
115,utb601_00116,"I burst out with laughter when Sophie's price task was revealed, great stuff!"
116,utb601_00117,Each contestant got a full five points for each task this episode.
117,utb601_00118,"It may sound like a brag, but after seeing the Q on the floor at the end, I guessed Quentin straight away given it’s probably the most common male Q name. I was ecstatic when I found out I was right!!"
118,utb601_00119,Oh man that was such a great episode. Chris Ramsey’s sausage cement mixer game was nothing short of genius! Genuinely think this is the best season since 7
119,utb601_00120,Oh this is going to be good to edit for the family show
120,utb601_00121,I love how wildly unprepared Chris was for his own game
121,utb601_00122,"""Does your letter...?"""
122,utb601_00123,omg i thought sophie actually was crying there for a second lmao
123,utb601_00124,Beaten by everyone... brilliant
124,utb601_00125,Why can't Bridget walk like a human? She did it in that maypole task as well.
125,utb601_00126,Ardal is clearly a hoopy frood who knows where his towel is.
126,utb601_00127,"I swear to god, with the combo of her slim-cut goth cowboy outfit and the unnatural way she was moving, Bridget started looking like the title character of Junji Ito's ""The Woman Next Door"""
127,utb601_00128,Chris is terrified of his own creation.
128,utb601_00129,SOPHIE’S MURDER MYSTERY IS GOLD.
129,utb601_00130,Ok I'm in love with Sophie
130,utb601_00131,Isn’t this just the movie Inside Out.
131,utb601_00132,You smell familiar.
132,utb601_00133,This is genuinely probably the best season since 7. Such an amazing cast this time :)
133,utb601_00134,"Wow I can't believe Alex and Co found a Quentin! I was so sure he'd be Quantum, Quantus or Quiz!"
134,utb601_00135,I missed the first ten minutes and turned it on as Ardel was forcing that mannequins head in a cement mixer. Wtf is the task?
135,utb601_00136,I wonder if Alex will actually have a nervous breakdown after dealing with Bridget for ten episodes.
136,utb601_00137,Sophie went where Sara Pascoe didn't.
137,utb601_00138,Chris Ramsey being scared of his own game ahahaha
138,utb601_00139,Chris demonstrating why you shouldn't leave your dog in the car on a warm day!
0,uyfgvb_00001,Ardal soaking bread in water and mixing it up with egg gave me anxiety knowing that he’d have to eat the mix if he used it. I’m quite relieved he mostly went with tofu at the end.
1,uyfgvb_00002,"And thus, custard face was born. I wonder if people will get cancelled for doing it in ~100 years time?"
2,uyfgvb_00003,"Shades of Citi Zeni's Eurovision entry in Sophie's sculpture, there..."
3,uyfgvb_00004,"Just me or are the Taskmaster Universe Lore gang (and the fanficcers) really snoozing on Greg calling Alex ""my love"" at the start of this week's live task?"
4,uyfgvb_00005,Best thing to stick my finger into would be the plastic bit on to top of a pack of toilet roll. Used to go around prodding a hole in all of them in the supermarket. Was it just me?
5,uyfgvb_00006,Who throws a shoe? Honestly!
6,uyfgvb_00007,"I'm sorry, but Judi was robbed on the sculpture task"
7,uyfgvb_00008,"‘I’ll give you my shoes, Judi.’ ‘But how am I supposed to kill you with your own shoe?’ This episode is so fucking quotable."
8,uyfgvb_00009,"Once again, thank you editors. The contrast between Chris successfully balancing a ladder on his chin, and Ardal failing to balance a SPOON was immaculate."
9,uyfgvb_00010,Series 11: viciously sabotaging each other in live tasks. Series 12: emotionally supporting each other in live tasks. Series 13: emotionally sabotaging each other in live tasks.
10,uyfgvb_00011,
11,uyfgvb_00012,"Greg: ‘If you don’t back yourself, who will?’ Bridget: ‘Nobody.’ Ardal: ‘Dr. Gerry.’"
12,uyfgvb_00013,OH GANG.
13,uyfgvb_00014,"""If I place your tofu ballerina above a vagina, I am finished"""
14,uyfgvb_00015,The Slight zoom on Judi after “how am I supposed to kill you with your own shoe” is killing me
15,uyfgvb_00016,"Oh well done Bridget, you have BROKEN Greg Davies with your induction story. He went from his normal pink faced stern good cheer to ashen horror in 2 seconds flat."
16,uyfgvb_00017,"""I gave you culture. Literature. Water."""
17,uyfgvb_00018,Sophie put her finger in and then she put her face in.
18,uyfgvb_00019,Bridget doing everything with ease compared to everyone else is hilarious
19,uyfgvb_00020,"I want a gif of Sophie saying ""I've made a huge mistake"" while sadly eating 100g of straight up butter."
20,uyfgvb_00021,I feel HEARD by Judi saying 'I think I'm in the popular mums whatsapp group' !
21,uyfgvb_00022,‘I’ll be that guy who hit that girl with a shoe.’
22,uyfgvb_00023,Lmfao I love the editing on this show Chris balancing tons of cool stuff on his chin and then ardal returns after 14 minutes to fuck up balancing a wooden spoon on his chin
23,uyfgvb_00024,"My favourite is different every week, but I gotta say right now it's Sophie because I find her combination of very smart cultural references and complete fucking chaos deeply appealing."
24,uyfgvb_00025,You know something has gone horrendously wrong when Bridget is the voice of reason
25,uyfgvb_00026,"‘Your statue must be entirely edible.’ Bridget: ‘That means you can eat it.’ Thanks, Bridget."
26,uyfgvb_00027,"""Lidl have sent me free stuff before"" If it's from the bakery, Judi wins."
27,uyfgvb_00028,At some point in every episode Ardal ends up on the floor??
28,uyfgvb_00029,I love that ardal is keeping up his worshiping of TM
29,uyfgvb_00030,I’m glad they got both shoes to throw rather than just the one like in normal chess rules.
30,uyfgvb_00031,Judging by her aim with the balls I'm so glad Bridget doesn't have a gun 😬
31,uyfgvb_00032,"As a British person, being told to show off would be my worst nightmare."
32,uyfgvb_00033,"Sometimes once you put your finger in, you do want to put your face in 😂"
33,uyfgvb_00034,"Judi's voice breaking from the sheer AUDACITY of her lie as she said ""I don't know how to show off, babes"" The AUDACITY."
34,uyfgvb_00035,“I can borrow a dog whenever I want”
35,uyfgvb_00036,Greg is being bloody generous with these points this week
36,uyfgvb_00037,Heg Davies
37,uyfgvb_00038,"After a slow start, Sophie is DOMINATING."
38,uyfgvb_00039,“HAVE YOU GOT MAGIC POWERS?!”
39,uyfgvb_00040,They are absolutely going to have to eat these
40,uyfgvb_00041,I love all the relationships this series. So. Much. Chemistry.
41,uyfgvb_00042,"Oh God the drastic switch in emotions. Bridget's precious ""please don't make me eat it..."" to Sophie eating a stick of butter LOL"
42,uyfgvb_00043,Bridget asking for a gun or an axe was equally hilarious and terrifying!
43,uyfgvb_00044,…oh gang
44,uyfgvb_00045,"There were some wild moments in the final task, but the exchange of “Bridget, do you have any thoughts going into this?” “No.” had me absolutely cackling."
45,uyfgvb_00046,I love it when people order themselves stuff. Like Dave's champagne or Jamali's beer. I think the same may be true of Ardal's steak.
46,uyfgvb_00047,They should have called the episode Broccoli Bumhole
47,uyfgvb_00048,"My brother walked in during the part where Ardel was choking down tofu and asked me if it was ""that british baking show."""
48,uyfgvb_00049,Judys «…But how am I supposed to kill you with your own shoe?» might be my favorite line of the series
49,uyfgvb_00050,"The big three: culture, literature, and water."
50,uyfgvb_00051,"“The nipples have browned, which is quite sweet.”"
51,uyfgvb_00052,"‘People in my town won’t wear high vis jackets’, genius!"
52,uyfgvb_00053,"I'm still confused, WHAT was Ardal doing for 14 minutes?"
53,uyfgvb_00054,"The editing of this episode is amazing. ""I can touch my toes"" - cut to Sophie holding her breath underwater."
54,uyfgvb_00055,"I'll be honest, I about had a panic attack when Alex came back from the first break and said it was time for the final task of the show. I thought I had blacked out or lost time. It's just been that kind of week. I really want to know what Bridget was planning to do with a gun or an axe in the ""show off"" task! I wonder how the censored version is going to deal with the breast and vulva sculptures. Bridget's whimpering ""don't make me eat it"" is about the cutest thing I ever saw. And it was really funny to see Sophie eating out her own creation. Broccoli bumhole and all! I had to laugh that Bridget was the only one who seemed to be making any sense during the pipe cocktail task. I think everyone has lost their minds by this point in the show. I think Sophie really unnerved Chris by standing behind her toilet roll tower. He clearly tried to aim low because he didn't want to hit her. An excellent strategy since everyone else ended up missing anyway. Greg (Heg?) was extremely generous with points this week. But I can't lie, I'm gutted that Judi didn't win this episode, babes."
55,uyfgvb_00056,Think Sophie managed to cater to a few obscure fetishes in that episode.
56,uyfgvb_00057,"If you want to find the painting that Sophie referenced with her sculpture it's called 'L'Origine du monde' (The origin of the world) by Gustave Courbet, and is very, very definitely NSFW."
57,uyfgvb_00058,I feel robbed that we didn't get to see Alex's reaction to Sophie talking through the female anatomy.
58,uyfgvb_00059,"After eating 100g of straight butter, if she didn't win it would have been a hate crime."
59,uyfgvb_00060,Sophie is a fucking Jedi!
60,uyfgvb_00061,This is my favourite episode so far. Bridget and Sophie eating their sculptures was hilarious. I was crying at Bridget trying not to eat hers. And Ardle with the egg shell 😂😂 Chris is such a sweetheart. He didn’t want to be known as the guy who hit the girl with the shoe. The cocktail task. Bridget being the voice of reason was hilarious. Her face when she said ‘can’t you use your hands’. I’m laughing now thinking about it. Judi Love is a legend. As is Bridget Christie.
61,uyfgvb_00062,‘Who’s Greg?’
62,uyfgvb_00063,"Chris: ‘All I can think of is cheese.’ Same, Chris. Same."
63,uyfgvb_00064,Ardal submerging bread in water like that should be a criminal offence.
64,uyfgvb_00065,IT'S LIKE CHESS
65,uyfgvb_00066,"""It is such a bad omen that Bridget is the smart one"""
66,uyfgvb_00067,Sophie is an absolute trooper. That's a powerful feminist act.
67,uyfgvb_00068,What a throw Ruined his tower in one hit
68,uyfgvb_00069,Judi made herself something nice to eat at least Poor Ardal - that must be grim
69,uyfgvb_00070,"Thanks, Bridget, going to get immediately sterilised 🤢"
70,uyfgvb_00071,Why was Sophie wearing handcuffs? I thought she was maybe going to try get out of them but then... she just kept them on
71,uyfgvb_00072,"I feel like each episode of this series is just getting better and better. My biggest highlights tonight were Bridget’s fart/childbirth putty, Ardal’s wooden spoon, Judi asking who Greg is, and Ardal’s cocktail shaking. Also loved Chris’ balancing acts, thought they were genuinely very impressive."
72,uyfgvb_00073,Custard face was terrifying.
73,uyfgvb_00074,I love Judi more and more every episode.
74,uyfgvb_00075,Well... tonight’s episode may have cemented this as my favourite series ever. Such a great bunch of contestants with brilliant tasks and great interactions between them all. So sad we only have 3 episodes left now though
75,uyfgvb_00076,Holy shit Sophie is a magician
76,uyfgvb_00077,I can’t believe Bridget is the one using logic.
77,uyfgvb_00078,"“Eat your exotic sandwich - I mean, sculpture. Fastest wins, time starts now.”"
78,uyfgvb_00079,Heg Rabies will always be my favourite Taskmaster
79,uyfgvb_00080,I'm guessing people here knew the deal with the sculpture task as soon as they saw the lunchbox?
80,uyfgvb_00081,Greg's scoring was insane this episode I love it
81,uyfgvb_00082,"Just when I was thinking that Bridget's attempt to ""show off"" was possibly the least impressive thing anyone had ever done, Ardal walked out with a wooden spoon."
82,uyfgvb_00083,why didn't we get a stat on how long Sophie was underwater?
83,uyfgvb_00084,so no one's talking about how Sophie quietly took the series lead in 2 episodes? cool. I'm excited for these last 3 episodes.
84,uyfgvb_00085,"There's the quote of the season: ""You didn't know who I fucking was!"""
85,uyfgvb_00086,HAVE YOU GOT A GUN?!
86,uyfgvb_00087,What have we just witnessed?! Twerking into a bucket
87,uyfgvb_00088,"‘Big up the Guildford Massive, Pete.’ It’s like Guz Khan never left."
88,uyfgvb_00089,This is another great episode. Love these guys.
89,uyfgvb_00090,SOPHIE IS BRUTAL.
90,uyfgvb_00091,“It’s like chess.”
91,uyfgvb_00092,
92,uyfgvb_00093,"Absolutely heartbreaking end. It would've been sad if Judi had just missed Sophie's tower twice but her changing course while even Sophie wanted her to knock down the tower and win was just crushing to watch. Fun episode, but I hope Judi is able to come away with an episode before the series is through."
93,uyfgvb_00094,Alex absolutely guffawing at Ardlo’s HiViz joke made my day.
94,uyfgvb_00095,I may never manage to forget the sight of ardal twerking a bucket of cocktails!
95,uyfgvb_00096,It's the exotic sandwich all over again!
96,uyfgvb_00097,Jesus Christ Bridget. Lol
97,uyfgvb_00098,LMAO poor Ardal has been completely upstaged
98,uyfgvb_00099,"Man, Ardal looks like he could use a grill or a book to cut that bread up."
99,uyfgvb_00100,“It’s delicious.” - Sophie on her… sculpture.
100,uyfgvb_00101,Bridget Christie is a crazy person and I can't get enough of it
101,uyfgvb_00102,Well it turns out watching Sophie eat 100 grams of butter didn’t diminish my crush on her. Quite the opposite.
102,uyfgvb_00103,"Ah, this live task is from NZ Series 2!"
103,uyfgvb_00104,I suspect Chris has made an error.
104,uyfgvb_00105,So did Sophie just get handcuffed and the hold her breath underwater without escaping said handcuffs? Or did I miss something?
105,uyfgvb_00106,Ardal has collapsed so many times this series I love it
106,uyfgvb_00107,"God damn, if Sophie Duker doesn't win Taskmaster, than we win her Papa!"
107,uyfgvb_00108,How much must have been cut from that prize task...
108,uyfgvb_00109,Sophie just looks so cool in her boiler suit and sunglasses.
109,uyfgvb_00110,Another superb episode from S13. But Greg's scoring was absolutely deranged.
110,uyfgvb_00111,"Damn, this is the episode I really became a fan of Sophie. Capping it off with the custard face; what a performance"
111,uyfgvb_00112,Have you got a gun? Oh god
112,uyfgvb_00113,"Out of all the things Judi has listed, getting sent free stuff by Lidl is the only thing that impressed me."
113,uyfgvb_00114,Wonder how they’ll do this on Taskmaster beeped
114,uyfgvb_00115,Broccoli bumhole should have been the episode title.
115,uyfgvb_00116,What a drastic change from the New Zealand version of this task!
116,uyfgvb_00117,"That live task felt really anticlimactic. Having said that, Sophie sticking her face in the custard makes this an all-time episode!"
117,uyfgvb_00118,Props to Sophie for eating that! Just the idea of it is giving me the boak!
118,uyfgvb_00119,"In the first task intro, Alex is looking at cards. I'm pretty sure those are the hands of somebody behind him."
119,uyfgvb_00120,Chris’s attempt was actually impressive.
120,uyfgvb_00121,Surprised they are repeating such an iconic task as the giedroyc sandwich.
121,uyfgvb_00122,This was the ep I went to the recording of! Was so great.
122,uyfgvb_00123,"Seems like a good rule of thumb is ""never cook anything you yourself would not eat."" Also, Bridget continues to be a treasure."
123,uyfgvb_00124,"Ah, jesus, 150g of raw tofu, strawberry jelly and eggshell."
124,uyfgvb_00125,Ep should have been called 'Broccoli Bum Hole'
125,uyfgvb_00126,
126,uyfgvb_00127,"The ladies really bring it, style wise, every week huh"
127,uyfgvb_00128,"Chris is so cute, he’s always giving other contestants fist bumps"
128,uyfgvb_00129,An entirely new meaning to eating pussy
129,uyfgvb_00130,OH GOD THE CUSTARD
130,uyfgvb_00131,I feel like the showing off task is the Father Dougal-est that Ardal has gotten so far.
131,uyfgvb_00132,absolutely pissing myself over judi lobbing sophie’s shoe at ardells tower. why did she do that?? hilarious
132,uyfgvb_00133,This show is FILTHY lmao
133,uyfgvb_00134,"""see what I'm going to call you after I read this"" lmfao"
134,uyfgvb_00135,"""This must be what an anteater feels like"""
135,uyfgvb_00136,How much better would the James Bond films be if that was how Bond’s martinis were made.
136,uyfgvb_00137,Bridget auditioning to be the next Susie Dent.
137,uyfgvb_00138,Why didn’t he smush the dairylea on the bread to eat?
138,uyfgvb_00139,Some of these people haven’t seen previous series.
139,uyfgvb_00140,
140,uyfgvb_00141,Absolutely 5pts to Sophie Duker.
141,uyfgvb_00142,"What an episode, every task a belter, especially the live task. Superb"
142,uyfgvb_00143,"Culture, literature, Water. The 3 RE’s"
143,uyfgvb_00144,"at least two of the tasks today likely draws inspiration directly from a task from previous series, but somehow it’s still as enjoyable as the other time they have done it"
144,uyfgvb_00145,"Is Judi a bit of a germaphobe? Nothing wrong with it, I just happened to notice she was the only one wearing gloves for the sculpture task, and then asking for gloves before she threw Sophie's shoes. Unless it's to save her nails breaking off again 😅"
145,uyfgvb_00146,Sophie is untouchable!
146,uyfgvb_00147,"What other show puts out their best series at 13, so good"
147,uyfgvb_00148,Ermmmm - where was Alex's random funny little introduction at the beginning of this week's show????
148,uyfgvb_00149,I love Jane Norman. What an icon.
149,uyfgvb_00150,"For once, Bridgette is the only one with any sense."
150,uyfgvb_00151,
151,uyfgvb_00152,Sophie you absolute legend.
152,uyfgvb_00153,DAMMIT JUDI! I had points on you. I still believe in her though. Maybe next week!
153,uyfgvb_00154,Where does 28 points rank amongst the highest for an episode ever?
154,uyfgvb_00155,I'm sad no one brought one of those 90s water tube toys.
155,uyfgvb_00156,“Who’s Greg?”
156,uyfgvb_00157,Anyone else hoping they release taskmaster tarot cards? I would pay top dollar* for taskmaster tarot cards. *no more than twenty british pounds
157,uyfgvb_00158,"I'm sorry, but I need to know what Bridget was going to use the gun for."
158,uyfgvb_00159,Prediction for the podcast: “show off” would be Ed’s least favourite task to have to do ever…
159,uyfgvb_00160,Thanks to Bridget for helping me learn what edible means.
160,uyfgvb_00161,It’s the second instance of a baby and nipples we’ve had on this show. I never thought it would happen again.
161,uyfgvb_00162,I really do not understand why it can take forever for C4 to upload episodes. Hadn't prepared dinner so was cooking when it was on. :/ I sometimes understand with live broadcasts but there's not really any excuses for pre-recorded and greenlit to air shows should have any issues being released immediately after broadcast. Grumble grumble...
162,uyfgvb_00163,"Taskmasters on, it is on now..."
163,uyfgvb_00164,"That is true, what Ardal said. Getting notions in Monaghan would probably be worse than getting Covid."
164,uyfgvb_00165,"Judi trying to get Chris back for the ""All the information is on the task"" and ""Everyone beat you"" then horribly backfiring is hilarious"
165,uyfgvb_00166,no way they did it again
166,uyfgvb_00167,I love that ardal is the only one wearing a apron
167,uyfgvb_00168,"Peter, pay attention for fucks sake"
168,uyfgvb_00169,100g of butter oof
169,uyfgvb_00170,Ardal got 3 points for that display lmfao
170,uyfgvb_00171,The puppet’s tiny task outfit!!
171,uyfgvb_00172,Judi's a fucking treasure
172,uyfgvb_00173,"I literally commented on this sub yesterday saying that I hope Alex is taking inspiration from TMNZ. And then they go and adapt one of their live tasks and even improve on it a bit. Love to see it! Edit: Since I commented this, I rewatched S1 for the first time since it aired - I did not realize they also used a couple NZ live tasks in S12 as well. They also significantly improved on the popup task (one of the few instances where no audience made it better)"
173,uyfgvb_00174,Sophie’s hair this episode is goals.
174,uyfgvb_00175,Ever not wanted to have kids? Bridget's story there will confirm your thoughts.
175,uyfgvb_00176,What is on ardal hair 😭
176,uyfgvb_00177,"Being Irish, the wooden spoon off the arse is one of the things that strike fear into me from my childhood!"
177,uyfgvb_00178,I have to know what the hell ardal was doing for 14 minutes
178,uyfgvb_00179,Eat your sculpture
179,uyfgvb_00180,I love the throwback to series 4’s task!!
180,uyfgvb_00181,Is that 28/30 points for Sophie?
181,uyfgvb_00182,We literally (re)watched the Taskmaster NZ episode with the same studio task last night. That was spooky timing. Even with 100% more shoes us Brits were barely any better too 🤦‍♂️
182,uyfgvb_00183,"Between the toilet paper / shoe task and the “show off” simple task (ala “Fly.”), the taskmaster nz influence was strong tonight. Love it."
183,uyfgvb_00184,what a magical and hilarious live task. sophie was truly powerful and fantastic contestant this episode and i hope judy can still win an ep
184,uyfgvb_00185,How do these episodes keep getting funnier and funnier? I’m already in tears
185,uyfgvb_00186,“Don’t try and do something else. Stay with the balls”
186,uyfgvb_00187,Sophie is a trooper
187,uyfgvb_00188,"Great episode, loved watching Chris Ramsey this series. That said I felt like the live task was flawed. The contestants looked like they were in a straight line and so with Chris in the middle his tower was always going to be the easiest to knock down. The towers on the edges (Ardal and Sophie) are at an angle from the throwing spot and harder to get."
188,uyfgvb_00189,"ARDAL. Oh, mate."
189,uyfgvb_00190,This is already such a strong episode
190,uyfgvb_00191,Judi’s STRAIGHT in there.
191,uyfgvb_00192,I’m starting to think we should burn Sophie as a witch.
192,uyfgvb_00193,Did Alex ever share how long Sophie held her breath underwater? Not sure if I just missed it.
193,uyfgvb_00194,Sophie’s whole look this week is impeccable
194,uyfgvb_00195,This task would be my worst nightmare oh god
195,uyfgvb_00196,"This episode has been so fast paced, and I'm beginning to see why! Theres so much good stuff to fit in!"
196,uyfgvb_00197,Anastasia 😭😭😭
197,uyfgvb_00198,Those? Arent? Alexs? Hands?
198,uyfgvb_00199,Nice to see Mike's casserole making a guest appearance as Bridget's entry in the prize task.
199,uyfgvb_00200,"If she's doing this from memory I'm genuinely impressed. I could do like, one full song maybe?"
200,uyfgvb_00201,I knew what the twist was going to be and I still loved it
201,uyfgvb_00202,I love when they have to eat what they do in these tasks. Lol
202,uyfgvb_00203,Lol Judi STRAIGHT IN
203,uyfgvb_00204,I'd actually be ok to eat Judi's I mean I'd have a severe sugar crash 20 minutes later. But I'd be game.
204,uyfgvb_00205,I really like raw tofu so I’d be good with Ardal’s but I recognise that I am the odd one out in this situation 😅
205,uyfgvb_00206,BIG UP THE GUILDFORD MASSIV
206,uyfgvb_00207,This whole task is deeply traumatic.
207,uyfgvb_00208,Anyone know why this isn't on All4 yet? I got home late and was so excited to watch
208,uyfgvb_00209,lol how does all4 make that more family friendly. I'm from the states where they would censor a vagina and boobs/nipples
209,uyfgvb_00210,"Oh man, I need this. World feels so crazy, it's nice to have something so funny and comforting. ❤️"
210,uyfgvb_00211,You knew before he even said Ireland he was going to be talking about Ardal. Dude’s out to win at all costs.
211,uyfgvb_00212,‘Show off.’ This task is made for Judi.
212,uyfgvb_00213,Judi really lucked in here
213,uyfgvb_00214,OH NO ARDAL
214,uyfgvb_00215,Props to ardal for eating even a tiny bit of the egg shell
215,uyfgvb_00216,"do people know when it'll be on all4? :/ can't seem to find it ninja: bleeped version seems to be on, but after watching the one bleeped epsiode I don't think I could put myself through that again"
216,uyfgvb_00217,They’ve skipped the banter AGAIN. Unacceptable!
217,uyfgvb_00218,Love a cocktail making task. Is this the third? Fourth?
218,uyfgvb_00219,Love the TM Tarot cards.
219,uyfgvb_00220,Anastasia.
220,uyfgvb_00221,Sophie doing some classic art there.
221,uyfgvb_00222,Bridget 😭
222,uyfgvb_00223,OH JUDI…
223,uyfgvb_00224,i was in years laughing for so much of this episode god
224,uyfgvb_00225,Why is the episode not up on all4 yet?
225,uyfgvb_00226,"What, no banter?!"
226,uyfgvb_00227,
227,uyfgvb_00228,I’m sad they skipped the banter again :(
228,uyfgvb_00229,Bridget is such a wild card!! 🤣
229,uyfgvb_00230,"I quite often do just eat spoonfuls of butter, so no sympathy for Sophie here."
230,uyfgvb_00231,Damn was Judis chance to win. Couple tasks perfect for her.
231,uyfgvb_00232,"The matching tracksuit, excellent 😂"
232,uyfgvb_00233,title drop!
233,uyfgvb_00234,
234,uyfgvb_00235,"Really hilarious, love this show"
235,uyfgvb_00236,Why didnt they make the sculptor from sugar paste or modelling chocolate?
236,uyfgvb_00237,Heg.
237,uyfgvb_00238,You know it’s good when Greg goes WOOO!
238,uyfgvb_00239,"Man, I don’t know what I would do if I was asked to show off."
239,uyfgvb_00240,CHRIS U LEGEND!!!!
240,uyfgvb_00241,I want a Chris. He’s adorable.
241,uyfgvb_00242,"I wonder if there was something in the wheelie bin, underneath all the rubber bricks."
242,uyfgvb_00243,Really human-centipedey this one
243,uyfgvb_00244,"Oh ardal, no 😱"
244,uyfgvb_00245,Oh Ardal... LOL
245,uyfgvb_00246,If Christ team set wasn’t so bad at the live tasks I reckon he’d be so far ahead. He’s came last in like all but one hasn’t he
246,uyfgvb_00247,FART… putty.
247,uyfgvb_00248,Greg doesn't rate Lidl. I don't rate Greg.
248,uyfgvb_00249,Here I thought he might have left Bridget alone at once to rub it in. I would have.
249,uyfgvb_00250,Chris has eaten raw spaghetti before?
250,uyfgvb_00251,"Bridgette had a more edible sculpture than most, but couldn’t eat it because she felt bad. I respect that. It won’t win her any points, but I respect it."
251,uyfgvb_00252,Well... tonight’s episode may have cemented this as my favourite series ever. Such a great bunch of contestants with brilliant tasks and great interactions between them all. So sad we only have 3 episodes left now though
252,uyfgvb_00253,Dr. Gerry looks like Rolf Harris.
253,uyfgvb_00254,What even is this story?
254,uyfgvb_00255,"Alternate episode title alert: ""The key finger goes in her brain"""
255,uyfgvb_00256,Fair play Chris.
256,uyfgvb_00257,It’s Alex’s packed lunch!
257,uyfgvb_00258,Chris's kids obviously don't get their school treats in lunchboxes
258,uyfgvb_00259,Dave Gorman needs to bring us his smash here!
259,uyfgvb_00260,Greg’s scoring is completely insane this week. All over the place. Worse than usual.
260,uyfgvb_00261,"So who will get one point, Ardal or Bridget?"
261,uyfgvb_00262,Isn't heg Mel's equivalent of megashit!
262,uyfgvb_00263,Is this a NZ task?
263,uyfgvb_00264,Anyone got the series scores?
264,uyfgvb_00265,Lee Mack also has a BAFTA.
265,uyfgvb_00266,Chris is doing well. Bridget isn’t.
266,uyfgvb_00267,… Sophie?
267,uyfgvb_00268,"Same, Chris. Same."
268,uyfgvb_00269,Hey it's another NZ one!
269,uyfgvb_00270,Chris has done an incredible job there wow
270,uyfgvb_00271,I've got a good feeling about Judi this episode!
271,uyfgvb_00272,Two words. Creme. Egg.
272,uyfgvb_00273,"What was the deal with the ad bumper? It flashed on Alex’s hand but nothing happened there, only “Taskmaster” appeared further to the left."
273,uyfgvb_00274,I only recognised one of the famous people Judi listed. I feel very out of the loop.
274,uyfgvb_00275,Sophie’s doing some dramatic poetry reading.
275,uyfgvb_00276,Have we had this task before?
276,uyfgvb_00277,Haven't we already had this task? Or something similar?
277,uyfgvb_00278,Channel 4 is doing a really annoying audio description for me. Don't know how to turn it off. So annoying.
278,uyfgvb_00279,"Judi’s either going to do very well, or very badly. I’m thinking the latter."
279,uyfgvb_00280,
280,uyfgvb_00281,
281,uyfgvb_00282,
282,uyfgvb_00283,
283,uyfgvb_00284,Tofu’s not edible.
284,uyfgvb_00285,
0,v3gt8c_00001,Lmao how timely to mention the Swedish PM facing a vote of no confidence
1,v3gt8c_00002,
2,v3gt8c_00003,"I absolutely love Sophie, she’s one of my favourites ever"
3,v3gt8c_00004,"Finally catching up with this episode. In the live task, when Greg said ""purple things"", I immediately said ""rain"". Then Bridget revealed having written down ""rain"". Now I am both happy and a little concerned..."
4,v3gt8c_00005,"I know this was recorded months ago. If it had been this week an obvious purlple thing to me would have been ""Elizabeth Line""."
5,v3gt8c_00006,So happy to see Fred again!
6,v3gt8c_00007,"Alex seemed to be having more fun than usual this episode. Greg even acknowledged this at one point with a stern glance. Loved the ridiculousness of the Swedish task. ""You tuper super"" is so funny, as was Sophie's judgy reaction to Fred not being a fan of McDonald's. I loved seeing Chris and Judy throw themselves under the bus with the ""hi guys"" during the scoring. The licking task was mostly unpleasant, but I have to say that Sophie has a very sexy tongue and I didn't mind her flob all that much. Bridget's tongue is also cute and I thought she had an advantage by not having a long range. And Judi's muted ""oh, for fuck's sake"" was just perfect. Ardal's long hat and shoes were a hoot, but Sophie's grieving ensemble was definitely the best and most stylish. And technically the length of her veil and the trailing of the shoes were longer than most. Really underwhelmed by the judging of that task. I've become accustomed to Judi's unamused glare and slow blink, but it's never not hilarious. The Jamaican ""frog"" and ""bird"" responses were priceless. But I'm so disappointed neither of the ladies kept the ""penis"" on their board. Sophie seems to be ahead on points at the end of this episode. Surprised that Chris has fallen so behind here, and Bridget actually has a good chance of catching up before the final."
7,v3gt8c_00008,Ardal randomly bursting into song was amazimg
8,v3gt8c_00009,"THE PERFECTLY AUDIBLE ""OH FOR FUCKS SAKE"" FROM JUDI... LMFAOOOOFOFOFJ"
9,v3gt8c_00010,Rain I love Bridget. That is genius.
10,v3gt8c_00011,"""I don't think I know who I am if I'm not licking those things anymore."" Sophie Fucking Duker, everybody."
11,v3gt8c_00012,If you're finding this gross just be glad you didn't see it live. There was a lot more.
12,v3gt8c_00013,"Ardal defiantly announcing after the task that he ""could speak Swedish all along, actually"" had me on the floor for some reason. He was just so weirdly combative about it as a statement."
13,v3gt8c_00014,Why is no-one discussing Chris apparently liking putting tennis rackets in his mouth?
14,v3gt8c_00015,"One of the greatest performances in a task ever from Sophie, followed immediately by one of the worst from Chris!"
15,v3gt8c_00016,*mmhmmmhmmmhmmmohforfuckssake*
16,v3gt8c_00017,This might be the most we've seen Alex break in 13 seasons!
17,v3gt8c_00018,Is this is the first time we've seen Little Alex Horne come across as genuinely remorseful about a task? He's constantly apologising and can barely look at them all
18,v3gt8c_00019,Body Parts... Fingers and Toes Give Judi the world
19,v3gt8c_00020,"What a brilliant series this is. Getting close! That Swedish Fred task = brilliant. Bridget's antics were proper Taskmastering - I've missed people trying sneaky tricks and these crafty approaches towards task. It's the one thing I've missed this series - everything else has been provided. Ardal's singing in fluent Swedish was a brilliant surprise that blindsided me - a lovely best-bit highlight for the series - he's been so good all the way through. Sophie getting too bogged down in a comedic/theatrical narrative to reach 4 points is so good and in-character for her. And Chris's 'Hi guys' then Judi's 'Hi guys' - brilliant, wonderful, warm comedy. God I love this tasking crew so much. The best series? Possibly, but they're all great. Also, Sophie's studio outfit rocks, of course. She and Bridget are some of the best-dressed TM contestants ever - I really hope Ardal wears the squeaky jacket in the final..."
20,v3gt8c_00021,Sophie's rollerskating witch widow is incredible
21,v3gt8c_00022,"I’m with Sophie, blueberries ARE purple."
22,v3gt8c_00023,Would have liked to see Bob Mortimer do this task because he asks such random questions when forced into stranger conversations.
23,v3gt8c_00024,Remember when we thought that Chris would run away with this series?
24,v3gt8c_00025,Both girls wrote down and erased penis. Nice.
25,v3gt8c_00026,"Gagging to put penis back, lol."
26,v3gt8c_00027,Props to the editors who had to wade through hours of raw spit footage. [Greg voice] I'm certain there's a market for that. [/Greg]
27,v3gt8c_00028,“THERE’S NO FUCKING SHOES!!!”
28,v3gt8c_00029,"Things that are nice to put in your mouth: Lemon, sherbet, ice lolly?"
29,v3gt8c_00030,While I'm sitting here waiting for the episode to start I thought I'd share my embroidery of Judi's fishfinger quote from last week. I shared it last week but it seemed to disappear in to a black hole and never showed on the sub https://i.redd.it/rlg0ahipz7291.jpg
30,v3gt8c_00031,"""... nice table."""
31,v3gt8c_00032,Judis perfectly audible for fuck sake has been one of my funniest moments of the series so far
32,v3gt8c_00033,I realise it's a total coincidence but big fan of Sophie wearing 'Eat The Rich' earrings on jubilee day.
33,v3gt8c_00034,Sophie Duker kept her tongue hanging out for 26 minutes. Generational.
34,v3gt8c_00035,I’m thinking Sophie’s going to do to this task what Rhod did to the not blinking task.
35,v3gt8c_00036,Every one of Sophie's outfits have been 🔥
36,v3gt8c_00037,Ardal's attempt feels like the most surreal Ingmar Bergman film
37,v3gt8c_00038,"“When we separate one, it’s either because they’ve done very well, or very very badly.” “This time it was genuinely a bit of both.”"
38,v3gt8c_00039,Actually pissing myself at Judi’s ‘bird’. Brilliant.
39,v3gt8c_00040,Ardal is phenomenal
40,v3gt8c_00041,“You can stop at any time.” Who wants to bet she was the last to do this?
41,v3gt8c_00042,The bullshitting is strong in this episode already and both Greg and Alex seem to really have the giggles too
42,v3gt8c_00043,lol Alex wants this to be over more than Sophie does
43,v3gt8c_00044,I have to say “no way” with Chris every time it happens in the intro now!
44,v3gt8c_00045,"Can’t believe Chris is only in third place - judging from the first couple of episodes, I was almost certain he’d win the full series by a landslide."
45,v3gt8c_00046,Greg mouthing 'I'm hot'...... that was admittedly quite hot
46,v3gt8c_00047,"Alex just openly laughing at Ardal, is the best"
47,v3gt8c_00048,"Alternate episode titles: ""My awful genitals."" ""Are you herring?"" ""The hummingbird dab."" ""It's very Milan."""
48,v3gt8c_00049,“It’s very Milan”
49,v3gt8c_00050,"Is no one going to mention ""tennis racket"" (Chris)??"
50,v3gt8c_00051,I knew someone had to put Purple Rain! Banger of a song and album!
51,v3gt8c_00052,"Not sure if Bridget was deliberately making a joke when she said she ""rubbed one out"" in reference to removing ""penis"" from her list of words, but that combined with Judi's gagging comment killed me."
52,v3gt8c_00053,I’m not surprised Judi finished with “fuck this.”
53,v3gt8c_00054,Sophie deserves to win the series just from that task alone
54,v3gt8c_00055,"Oh god, Bridget has been left by herself"
55,v3gt8c_00056,"I can't really put my finger on it, but I felt this was the weakest episode of an otherwise strong series, despite a cameo by Fred the Swede. None of the tasks seemed that interesting, and that's even with the tongue task which promised a lot and in the end was only so-so. (I think Greg should have called out Bridget on that one.)"
56,v3gt8c_00057,"I wish we’d found out more about Sophie’s long footed, mourning babushka character. Bet there was a great story …"
57,v3gt8c_00058,I'm choosing to believe this order means that Bridget's smashed it.
58,v3gt8c_00059,Chris confirming that he’s part golden retriever with that drool string
59,v3gt8c_00060,Chris is having a breakdown
60,v3gt8c_00061,Ardal doing a callback from a task 5 minutes earlier was a highlight of the series for me.
61,v3gt8c_00062,Ardal with a standard description of a Saturday night in an Irish pub
62,v3gt8c_00063,…knob?
63,v3gt8c_00064,Awww no they broke Chris!
64,v3gt8c_00065,Ardal is fucking brilliant.
65,v3gt8c_00066,Will Bridget just sing an ABBA song at poor Fred
66,v3gt8c_00067,On Twitter the producer said this was the grossest task ever - oh god
67,v3gt8c_00068,Bridgets tiny tongue makes sense with her ant throat
68,v3gt8c_00069,Jesus Christ Sophie
69,v3gt8c_00070,"If Ardal was actually half decent at prize tasks, he'd comfortably be up there. Also, FRED"
70,v3gt8c_00071,"I think it’s partly because it’s Friday night and I’m tired, but Ardal writing “knob” made me laugh so hard I had to pause. It is genuinely a top 5 season moment for me because I’m an utter child."
71,v3gt8c_00072,"Ardal's song was quite something, great story too!"
72,v3gt8c_00073,Holy shit she ate everything.
73,v3gt8c_00074,Oh my god Ardal has smashed this
74,v3gt8c_00075,Was anyone not bothered in the slightest by the saliva task? Alex even gave a spittle warning as if it would be genuinely unsettling. Maybe I'm the minority and don't get freaked out by saliva. Would only be uncomfortable if it was me watching myself do it.
75,v3gt8c_00076,Are you herring?
76,v3gt8c_00077,"Nah, see, I'm immune to this as a disgusting spectacle, I worked as a nursery assistant and the amount of dribble these adults produce is nothing in comparison to a room full of teething 10 month olds."
77,v3gt8c_00078,Why did Sophie dress as Bridget?
78,v3gt8c_00079,"Lol, before the licking task I was like “spit isn’t that gross, I’ll be fine” but the pools of lumpy white spittle and globs of licked-up popsicle were too much even for me. I salute you, Alex."
79,v3gt8c_00080,Return of Fredrick the Swede! 🥳
80,v3gt8c_00081,The Bäst i Test reference via horrible pun as a lead-in was impeccable
81,v3gt8c_00082,ah...the Katherine Ryan technique...
82,v3gt8c_00083,Oh my god. Did he say 26 minutes?
83,v3gt8c_00084,Ardal looks so adorable
0,v8oruo_00001,
1,v8oruo_00002,"I would have gotten a chair, lots of fluffy pillows, duct tape. Stood on the chair, bent over, wrapped my butt in the pillows, duct taped it all together, and tried to pretend it was my head."
2,v8oruo_00003,Bridget is so fit. Also so heartbreaking judi lost.
3,v8oruo_00004,2 points for a basket of worms? wtf?!
4,v8oruo_00005,Who played the Welsh king? He was incredibly handsome!
5,v8oruo_00006,"So was the red room they walked through before hitting the shower curtain a red herring? I feel like there might have been something in those balloons to help them (like a ""the size of whatever you put out of the curtain will be doubled""). There had to be a reason there were those balloons, and that the room had a camera in it."
6,v8oruo_00007,"When Ardal got his predicted number and they gave him high fives and Bridget said ""well done Ardal"" it came across as if they were all his grandchildren who humour him. wish Greg had leaned into that."
0,vdtyho_00001,"Taskmaster is usually able to make me laugh, but this season, I've lost track of how many times I've cackled like an absolute madman. S13 was the greatest so far. All of the contestants brought absolute insanity to the show."
1,vdtyho_00002,All five of them dancing Sophie's weird little dance together while Greg and Alex stand in the superman pose really tickled me. God I'm going to miss this cast!
2,vdtyho_00003,"I definitely understand this argument. Such a great group of people. Chris Ramsey in particular has so much joy and energy and its infectious. Ill admit that 13 was a more complete cast than 11. Lee Macks comedy was neutered by the editing and there is a reason why Charlotte is not a stand up comedian - but Wozniak is so incredibly talented and interesting, Jamali Maddix and Alex Hornes interactions were some of the best the show has ever seen, and Sarah was one of the most impressive task solvers the show has ever seen. For what its worth, I dont think your love of 13 is recency bias. It was an incredible season. Plus, how many of us had recency bias for Series 6, 8 or 10? I dont remember them being well received on Reddit."
3,vdtyho_00004,Pretty late but what a season! I'd argue this had the funniest studio banters. Also evident in Alex's reactions. I miss all of the contestants already. Pretty excited about the possibility for an all-women CoC 3!
4,vdtyho_00005,
5,vdtyho_00006,"*~Definitive series rankings~*(Actually not remotely definitive) 7 > 5 > 13 > 4 >> 1 > 12 > 9 > 11 > 2 > 3 >> 6 > 10 > 8 Bloody difficult and could change tomorrow, but there you are. I'd say the top 4 are the top 4, there's a gap between 4 and 1. Likewise, 6, 10 and 8 are a fairly clear bottom 3 imo. And the middle ones are the middle ones."
6,vdtyho_00007,not going to lie all thats been stuck in my head for the past few days is “one dream one team house queens”
7,vdtyho_00008,SOPHIE DUKER I LOVE THAT YOU WON YOUR RAPS DURING TASKMASTER ARE PREETY COOL HOPE YOU WILL DO MORE IN CHAMPION OF CHAMPIONS 3
8,vdtyho_00009,"lmao they really roasted bridget hard during the song task. that was funny. also, this ep could’ve also been titled “humming or some shit” haha"

11,vdtyho_00012,"And the final image of the fantastic five dancing Bridget's dance, hand-in-hand, Sophie clutching her trophy, while the Taskmaster and his assistant sternly view the scene, the latter holding his comportment despite the inner anticipation and excitement of the wrap party to come... Thank you, Judi, Ardal, Bridget, Chris, and Sophie. Each of you has risen to the tasks set. Each of you has given your all. Each of you has made this series a delight. Thank you, Little Alex Horne, for bringing us one of the best series of one of the best shows. And all hail to the man whose judgement is as true as he is physically intimidating. Hail, TM!"
12,vdtyho_00013,Alex gaslighting the men LMAO
13,vdtyho_00014,The boys' song is simultaneously the best and worst thing I've ever heard.
14,vdtyho_00015,sophie’s sign changing is so fucking funny omg

22,vdtyho_00023,"It's no ""I'm Always Seeing You (Do Cool Stuff)""."
23,vdtyho_00024,"The dance at the end was so wholesome What a series, they were one of the best ever panels"
24,vdtyho_00025,Judi: [lovely backing vocals] Sophie: [quality rap verses] Bridget: [silly little dance] They've really covered all possible bases.
25,vdtyho_00026,Sophie seems legitimately so happy about it
26,vdtyho_00027,Ardal’s wearing the jacket!
27,vdtyho_00028,“Put an aubergine in my mouth” is the spiritual successor to Matt Heath’s “we’re gonna eat your ass”
28,vdtyho_00029,MAGNIFICENT lateral thinking from both Bridget and Sophie.
29,vdtyho_00030,She broke the bike! Genius! And then she completely fucked it by carrying more than one. Rofl
30,vdtyho_00031,ardal's just singing a song about mr t putting an aubergine in his mouth. and chris is making bird noises
31,vdtyho_00032,"Historic in a few ways: most already pointed out the first POC winner, but Sophie’s the first winner since Rob Beckett to be the youngest of the five Bridget must have the best average for prize tasks and studio tasks that’s in the high 3s Bridget also being the first contestant to ever have previous footage used again for entertainment value Judi’s the people’s champion, it’s a shame she never got her episode win. Haha."
32,vdtyho_00033,I just know making fun of bridgets walk went on for 5-10 minutes in the room

38,vdtyho_00039,"Great season, one of my favourites. Top 3 definitely. One thing that irked me (and I don't know why I should care but I do) but having a subjectively scored studio task for the finale was a little strange. Obviously there's no bias involved, but something more absolute would have made for a more thrilling ending."
39,vdtyho_00040,"Bridget and Sophie fucking with Alex on the bike is everything I live for on Taskmaster. Such brilliant subversive moves and I wish contestants would find more ways around tasks like in the earlier seasons. The culmination of Alex riding Judi while she's riding the bike is the hardest I've laughed all week. And I've needed it, desperately. The House Queens killed it, as did Bridget Christie's fluttery bird whistle baseline. I liked the callback to her silly walk episode as well, which they were all doing together as the episode closed. Overall this season, I found Greg being extra nice to Alex kind of creepy, but ultimately sweet. Their relationship has really taken a lot of twists and turns throughout 13 series. I don't know if she was crying for real at the end, but I found it really touching when Sophie accepted her trophy. I think she deserved it, although it was really neck and neck with Chris. I'm sad that it's over. Just like every season, I'll miss the camaraderie of the cast, even though I know we'll get another memorable lineup next time. And Champion of Champions 2 is waiting in the wings, ready to give us all the support we need. Nothing left to say, except ""Put an aubergine in my mouth."" (I thought this would be a reference that would get paid off later?)"
40,vdtyho_00041,Ardal’s “red leather jacket” attitude tonight. He really is stirring for all he’s worth.
41,vdtyho_00042,"Judi, not the actual champion, but the champion of our hearts."
42,vdtyho_00043,So pleased to have one last moment of bridled Alex-Bridget passive aggressiveness during the duck task: 'how long do you have to stay there for?' 'seven more seconds... im sure youre making the most of it' (And then Alex's quiet mumbled 'frustrating' when Bridget's task ended.)
43,vdtyho_00044,renk being judi’s official guess because she didn’t say anything else is so fucking judi
44,vdtyho_00045,You put an aubergine in my mouth...
45,vdtyho_00046,Something about Judi desperately burglurizing Alex on the bike made me laugh the hardest this season
46,vdtyho_00047,"""Live"" winner's reaction via their housemate (unclear whether it's one of the Dutch militia) https://twitter.com/SaimaFerdows/status/1537554443838836741"
47,vdtyho_00048,"Ardal interrupting Bridget to make her pronounce DNA was incredible And then she did it too! Great start to the episode and it just continued. Judi breaking the bike was fantastic and the songs are wonderful of course. Great series. Ardal was my favourite because I just loved his shit stirring, but everyone was super enjoyable! Loved it."
48,vdtyho_00049,I was really unsure about this one when the contestants were announced but it ended up being one of my favourite ever Taskmaster series'
49,vdtyho_00050,"Fantastic final episode. Fantastic series. I'm going to miss this lineup, it's been hilarious!"
50,vdtyho_00051,"I look forward to Sophie’s amazing outfits every week but I literally gasped when I saw her in-studio finale outfit, she looked like a painting. I remain very gay for her Also knew we were in for a great finale when I saw Ardal in his leather jacket lmao"
51,vdtyho_00052,i’d feel good at being the highest scoring loser ever though. no shame judi.
52,vdtyho_00053,"Bullshittery. Funny walks. No way! The ducks. Return of the audience. Sniping between the contestants. Judi Love. Honestly, the best series of all time."
53,vdtyho_00054,Sophie is legitimately cool as hell
54,vdtyho_00055,What a series. I will miss all of these absolute nutters immensely.
55,vdtyho_00056,"Sgoutout to our Sister Queen Judi, who has made Alex break character and laugh in the studio more than any other contestant in TM history."
56,vdtyho_00057,"We've had ""Put an aubergine in my mouth"" and ""Give that wolf a banana"" in the space of a month"
57,vdtyho_00058,"All I can say is ""no way"""
58,vdtyho_00059,"If Lolly Adefope is watching this, she'll be getting major fishbowl flashbacks."
59,vdtyho_00060,"I think I want a sitcom with Bridget and her exasperated roommate Alex (a SpongeBob and Squidward dynamic) with Greg as their landlord. Other tenants of the building include - Ardal as the bachelor uncle living with his nephew and niece, Chris and Sophie, while Judi plays the hip neighbour. Edit: Grammar"
60,vdtyho_00061,HER EYES!! WHY IS BRIDGET DOING THAT ???
61,vdtyho_00062,The lord giveth (a Sophie Duker victory) and the lord taketh away (no episode wins for Judi). I will see Bridget’s House Queen stomp-dance in my dreams for months.
62,vdtyho_00063,"“Alex always helps...” If we've learnt anything from this series, it's that statement is false."
63,vdtyho_00064,I wonder what Sophie will do with Judi’s blood and the teeth of Bridget’s children.
64,vdtyho_00065,"""This tastes like ass....Is it Dr Pepper?"""
65,vdtyho_00066,They’re doing the Bridget dance
66,vdtyho_00067,"Not fishing for sympathy or anything, but my rabbit died last night, I've been quite cut up about it, and this made me laugh like a drain, which was lovely. Sincere thanks to all involved for these 45 minutes of pure joy."
67,vdtyho_00068,"Iconic dancing/movements from Bridget. The gunslinger outfit makes it even better. Great series, great contestants. Congratulations Sophie."
68,vdtyho_00069,I wish they made Judi do a task by herself. I’m sure her reaction+bullshitting power wouldve been hilarious
69,vdtyho_00070,"Champion of Champions 3 is going to be absolute madness, isn't it?"
70,vdtyho_00071,"You know, she still missed out about a third of deoxyRIBOnucleic acid."
71,vdtyho_00072,Genuinely adorable all of them dancing
72,vdtyho_00073,YOU PUT AN AUBERGINE IN MY MOUTH
73,vdtyho_00074,"Fantastic team song from the House Queens!! That should be released as single, as should be the “I always see you do cool stuff”"
74,vdtyho_00075,God I'm going to miss Judi
75,vdtyho_00076,I'm hearing reports that The House Queens have blocked Kate Bush from reaching the top of the Singles Chart.
76,vdtyho_00077,I nearly cried laughing at Judi explaining how her blood could be used
77,vdtyho_00078,"I said it at 3 episodes in and my opinion never waivered. I legit think this is a contender for a top Taskmaster series. Chemistry of the cast was great, I thought everyone was amazing, and I think there's some great and memorable tasks. Series 12 I was excited for but dropped out halfway through because it just didn't capture me, but I looked forward to every single episode each week for 13. Also Judi may have come in last, but she came in first in my heart."
78,vdtyho_00079,Judi can sing!
79,vdtyho_00080,"What a delightful episode! I love all five of these people yet I must admit I was pulling for Chris a bit, but Sophie was absolutely brilliant on the bike task, she deserved the win just for that. Bringing Bridget's stepping back was too funny, I was crying laughing along with the cast. And how precious were they at the end, dancing together? I loved this cast so much. Series 12 was lovely because everyone seemed to get on and root for each other, and this series was much the same--but they didn't have a problem going after each other either, which was delightful."
80,vdtyho_00081,Sophie and Alex finally bonding.
81,vdtyho_00082,"I was rooting for Chris but when I watched the House Queens I knew it was deservedly over. Think Greg was a little overly generous on the prize and live tasks in this one but no denying the the girls absolutely SMASHED the song task. Fun one to end on, though I thought the liquid task felt more like a mid-series task than a grand final. Bummed we won't get to see Chris, Bridget, or Ardal again but Sophie will be great to watch in CoC3. This was a repeat of series 12 for me, everyone was so great that even though the winner was fantastic, I can't help but feel sad for everyone else not winning."
82,vdtyho_00083,"This was a great series, enhanced by being the first in front of a crowd for a while. Not sure how anyone else feels, but I think Greg's scoring was super lax over the series. It must be the least '1 point' scores he's given across a series. Really felt for Chris, but Sophie was a deserved winner."
83,vdtyho_00084,"Probable it got cut for time or wasn't entertaining enough, but is there a possibility they dropped the aubergine task so Chris and Ardal would look even sillier?"
84,vdtyho_00085,"""There's rice at home, Chris"""
85,vdtyho_00086,"I knew Bridget keeps her children’s teeth because she mentioned it on Off Menu, where she also mentioned she keeps their umbilical cords and hair."
86,vdtyho_00087,I need the Bridget dancing GIF
87,vdtyho_00088,Did this season have the shortest contestants? Sophie was dwarfed by both Greg and Alex when they hugged--and she was wearing chonky shoes too! She seemed to be similar height to the rest of the contestants.
88,vdtyho_00089,“I SAVED NINETY DUCKS LIVES” i’m gunna die 💀
89,vdtyho_00090,"Judi's face when she realized Sophie won 💗💗💗, so happy for her"
90,vdtyho_00091,Finally caught up with last night’s episode. I had so much fun watching this series! I think it’s easily taken the top spot for my favourite TM series of all time. I’m actually pretty sad it’s over. Also someone tell me why I cried when Sophie cried about her win. I’m literally a grown fucking woman crying over a panel show.
91,vdtyho_00092,Judi Love and Alice Levine: blood sisters
92,vdtyho_00093,"As much as I love The House Queens performance, brandy, water and milk would be a great title"
93,vdtyho_00094,SOPHIE DUKER SUPREMACY
94,vdtyho_00095,Perfect final shot. I missed the group celebrations.
95,vdtyho_00096,I’m not saying one team is obviously better. But. The House Queens are genuinely 🔥
96,vdtyho_00097,They’re doing the Bridget Dance!!!
97,vdtyho_00098,What an absolutely wonderful series. One of the very very best
98,vdtyho_00099,i was so happy for sophie!! she looked genuinely tearful when she won and was so gracious on TMP!!
99,vdtyho_00100,"Can Judi love please release a song? Her part of the song is stuck in my head now, so catchy!"
100,vdtyho_00101,🎵Put an aubergine in my mouth 🎵
101,vdtyho_00102,I know Champion of Champions is only one episode but C4 saying it ‘starts’ next week gave me a flicker of hope.
102,vdtyho_00103,"BRIDGET'S LICKING EYES! This is not a human being, this is a Time Lord. She's pure Gallifreyan."
103,vdtyho_00104,"Bridget is either inspired, or absolutely terrible. No in-between."
104,vdtyho_00105,Secret aubergine task!!!!
105,vdtyho_00106,It looks like they were doing a cult dance at the end
106,vdtyho_00107,I hope someday they start a worst of the worst edition; Judy Love would wipe the floor with the other contestants!
107,vdtyho_00108,Hahaha I love that Bridget's done that and Alex still had to keep cycling round the whole time 😂
108,vdtyho_00109,"""That's totally fair"" ""... well that's no fun. :("""
109,vdtyho_00110,Mark and Nish this is not...
110,vdtyho_00111,By far the most laugh out loud season of UK taskmaster for me
111,vdtyho_00112,"Such a great series! And what a great winner in Sophie! Loved how much of a slow build her emergence as the champion was. When Episode 1 dropped, I thought she could end up taking it all after she went outside the box on the duel task by turning it into a freestyle duel. But then it felt like the next several episodes were more Chris/Bridget/Ardal-centric when it came to point totals so I wondered if she would be stuck a bit in the background. So cool that she went on to win 3/5 episodes in the latter half."
112,vdtyho_00113,Chris sequentially hating every part of this task separately is such a mood
113,vdtyho_00114,"""I want to remind you that they can only hold one duck at a time"" I... don't think Judi's going to win tonight."
114,vdtyho_00115,Release the aubergine cut
115,vdtyho_00116,Genuinely cried laughing during that song
116,vdtyho_00117,"I think this is one of the top 3 series of TM (IMO 4 and 12 top 13). Although I really liked Ardal and Chris, the women were next-level in this series. Judi Love has one of the best deadpan abilities to launch into complete madness until called on it when she bursts out laughing. Sophie Duker is an amazing contestant with the creativity and problem-solving skills to set the bar. And Bridget Cristie created some of the most fun television - she honestly seemed like she was from another planet in some tasks. The final espisode had everything I want. Alex cycling and being tackled during the duck task. Bridget's dance montage. Perhaps the finest taskmaster anthem since taskenbury. The liquid ID task which left the contestants and Alex covered with muck. The portrait task (shout out to NZTM). My only complaint is that it seemed like there were fewer hidden solutions (not like there was a list of the liquids projected on the bottom of the table or something) and the multi-episode easter eggs (Alex saying the names of fish while giving out tasks) seemed to have receeded. Overall a stunner of a season and pleased that seasons 12 and 13 have been so good. Makes me optimistic for 14!"
117,vdtyho_00118,Judi won't even use her own wrist! Absolutely classic.
118,vdtyho_00119,The face touch 😭
119,vdtyho_00120,Fever dream number 1000 after this series
120,vdtyho_00121,Yes Sophie!! I hope she continues terrifying Alex in COC3
121,vdtyho_00122,"One of the best series for me, absolutely loved it and got me through some tough times over the past few months. TM forever ❤️"
122,vdtyho_00123,Greg is in tears
123,vdtyho_00124,i’m so happy for sophie! cant wait for her morgana and sarah in coc3
124,vdtyho_00125,"By far the best series yet. I'm so sad it's over, but props to Sophie for winning. Also with how much they've hammered on Judy losing they have to be setting up a Loser of Losers special, yeah? And the trophy is like...Greg's foot or something. No shoe, just full on gangly toenails and all."
125,vdtyho_00126,I enjoy that Alex had to tell her to take the lid off. That’s how much Alex felt sorry for her. He’d never do that normally.
126,vdtyho_00127,Bridget !!!! That's lateral tasking if I've ever seen it. And Sophie making Alex go around in circles! Literally just torturing him!! Genius.
127,vdtyho_00128,I am so hypnotised by Sophie’s ahhing
128,vdtyho_00129,If only Bridget had put the ducks in one at a time she would have won the episode
129,vdtyho_00130,"Damn that was amazing! Ardal was on fire during the prize task this week. I love that apparently his initial plan during the recording of the task was to really suck up to Greg, but when it came to the actual studio recording he just chose violence. Loved that he wore the jacket as well."
130,vdtyho_00131,I genuinely think Judi’s vocals could lead a massive house banger. Make it happen Calvin Harris or David guetta or someone else I’m too old and uncool to have heard of
131,vdtyho_00132,"I just wanna give a huge shout out to everyone on the sub. I haven’t watched the last 5 episodes until tonight and fortunately was never spoiler about the winner. So thank you everyone for that, I don’t think I ever went unspoiled for a finale that I was late on watching. Also shout out to the winner!!! So happy that they won!!! Would’ve been happy with anyone winning really."
132,vdtyho_00133,“balloon juice” lmfaooo love that answer chris
133,vdtyho_00134,"Chris walking backwards ks making me feel things. Bridget's 'walk' coming full circle with the House Queens was delightful! Damn, this was such a great series, already want to rewatch."
134,vdtyho_00135,Ardal looks great in that jacket.
135,vdtyho_00136,judi clapping ardel’s bullshit
136,vdtyho_00137,Deoxyribonucleic acid. She's got it wrong.
137,vdtyho_00138,Release the cut tasks!!
138,vdtyho_00139,Release the aubergine cut.
139,vdtyho_00140,SOPHIE! SOPHIE! SOPHIE!
140,vdtyho_00141,Congrats to Sophie!!! I’m guessing s14 lineup will be next week after COC2
141,vdtyho_00142,"I called it about 3 episodes in that this was going to be my favourite series. And its delivered every episode and had me crying with laughter. What a fantastic show, just so lovely to laugh so hard when the rest of the world is burning around you"
142,vdtyho_00143,"I fell in love with Chris and wanted him to win, but I am not sad with Sophie pulling it off. Great series. Everyone was an absolute delight."
143,vdtyho_00144,"So sad series 13 is over. It wasnt necessarily the funniest series (2, 5, 7, and 11 are probs the funniest) but certainly one of the most pleasant, relaxing and warm ones. They have gotten great at putting a cast together, So Im sure we will all love 14s cast."
144,vdtyho_00145,"They did Bridget dirty! 😂😂😂 Side-note: I always end up absolutely loving one contestant in particular but, this time no losers, I love them all!"
145,vdtyho_00146,"Bridget's bizarre liquid-sampling sex faces, and Chris's balloon juice squirting and visceral grunting... this is already quite the episode."
146,vdtyho_00147,"Death, Taxes, and Judi coming up with the episode titles"
147,vdtyho_00148,First Taskmaster series I've watched while currently airing and it has been amazing
148,vdtyho_00149,I still can't believe Chris didn't win this series....talk about fumbling the bag
149,vdtyho_00150,So who has the gif of Bridget from the music video?
150,vdtyho_00151,"Judi being on her own on this task, Colour me surprised. She's either going to smash or or not try at all."
151,vdtyho_00152,THE LOLLY ADEFOPE EDIT
152,vdtyho_00153,"I honest to god can't think of any other show that has me laughing aloud, wheezing, watching along. The bike task KILLED me 🤣🤣🤣 and then the song... oh my god. Greg and Alex this episode had the perfect banter, it was just all amazing!!!"
153,vdtyho_00154,Ardal’s shithousery has given me such SUCH joy this season.
154,vdtyho_00155,"""They can still...have...my blood."" 🤌"
155,vdtyho_00156,“All the instructions are- on the items.” The little stumble as he tries not to say the phrase.
156,vdtyho_00157,Sophie's reversing of the arrows was genius. probably harder for Alex to do as well 😂
157,vdtyho_00158,BRILLIANT CALLBACK
158,vdtyho_00159,I'm guessing s14 gets announced at end of coc2 then
159,vdtyho_00160,"My only issue was with the fact that Alex referred to Judi as the ""highest scoring loser"" instead of ""highest scoring last place"" because... well... Ardal, Bridget, and Chris also technically lost? Out of all the last places in previous series, sure, but she wasn't the only person who didn't win. Semantics really, but still just like... c'mon Alex! Also after the first two episodes I called it was going to be down to Chris and Sophie. As much as I adore Ardal and Judi, they were both having too much fun with it, and Bridget was... well... Bridget :P"
160,vdtyho_00161,"As someone who got the piss taken out of him for pronouncing heirloom as hairloom, I am glad to hear Judy say it too :P"
161,vdtyho_00162,I was routing for Chris the entire time and think he should have probably won or at least tied this episode since as Sophie should have had 3 points for the final task (I think Greg might have been too kind with some of the points too in some parts). But I'm happy with Sophie winning it was deserved but I was hoping for a tiebreak to end the series
162,vdtyho_00163,I don't know that I laughed so hard at an episode before. This one had me absolutely laughing hysterically.
163,vdtyho_00164,"Mum: ""There's rice at home."" Rice at home:"
164,vdtyho_00165,An aubergine in my mouth 😂😂😂
165,vdtyho_00166,Show us the aubergine task.
166,vdtyho_00167,"Not gonna lie disappointed that Ardal didn't break out ""my lovely horse"""
167,vdtyho_00168,Damn I was expecting a cast reveal for next season!
168,vdtyho_00169,Ardals got the jacket!
169,vdtyho_00170,"""It's not Italian, but it is... a rice cooker."""
170,vdtyho_00171,"""Alex always helps!"" Ahh, Judi. If only you knew. (Wonder if this task was filmed early on.)"
171,vdtyho_00172,Did someone say Song Task? Rosalind's a fucking nightmare!
172,vdtyho_00173,Aubergine in my mouth 😭😭😭
173,vdtyho_00174,So Sophie got her manky rice cooker back plus some blood and teeth
174,vdtyho_00175,
175,vdtyho_00176,Incredibly strong prize task section from this bunch of Titanic-class Bullshitters.
176,vdtyho_00177,I think I've said it every week now but I bloody love Bridget. Lol
177,vdtyho_00178,GENIUS! TAKING THE BASKET!
178,vdtyho_00179,Genius from Sophie as well!
179,vdtyho_00180,i love the tender moments between the taskmaster and his assistant
180,vdtyho_00181,"""put an aubergine in my mouth"" imgfhghjfjd"
181,vdtyho_00182,"Bridget the only one to think to use something other than her vocals for some sound, even though the task specifically said you could."
182,vdtyho_00183,This is the prime example of the 3 dragons meme with the silly one at the side being bridget
183,vdtyho_00184,"The Diverse Stripes v The House Queens, its the new Blur v Oasis."
184,vdtyho_00185,Bez. Jesus Ardal brings the heat.
185,vdtyho_00186,A worthy champion.
186,vdtyho_00187,I’m going to miss this cast so much!!
187,vdtyho_00188,"My methods for the duck task:. -put a shoe in the wheel. -step on the chain to disconnect it (which somehow happened a minute after I thought about it). -Noticed the arrows, but didn't think it would trap Alex in a small circle. What an episode. Great series. Loved it."
188,vdtyho_00189,"Though I liked the final live task, would have loved it even more if it was an objective task instead of a subjective one or even a Prisoner's Dilemma one like the Donut task."
189,vdtyho_00190,"When Sophie did that duel with Alex in episode 1, and the great way she presented it, I had a feeling she'd do well Like many, I thought Chris would win at that stage but she showed early on that she could go"
190,vdtyho_00191,"The boys’ started off nice, but quickly became more chaotic than jazz."
191,vdtyho_00192,Put an aubergine in my mouth is the same as we'll eat your ass from Matt heath
192,vdtyho_00193,Please show the aubergine task
193,vdtyho_00194,SOPHIE DUKER SUPREMACY
194,vdtyho_00195,"Careful with the spoilers, some people haven't watched it yet. https://twitter.com/sophiedukebox/status/1537539965776699393"
195,vdtyho_00196,Who would win the rap battle: The House Queens or The Three Friends?
196,vdtyho_00197,"After finishing this series I can say that my god, it is really one of the best so far. I enjoyed all of the contestant and the tasks where great. For one, I really loved that Judy was what I was expecting from Victoria on S12. Besides that, I have to say that it feels a little unreal that Sophie won, she was great but I think that she was overshadowed by the wonkiness of Bridgett and the efficiency of Chris. I was sure that Chris would come back on top on the final episode, but I actually enjoyed Sophie during the series, and do not mind at all she won."
197,vdtyho_00198,Prediction: Judi punctures the bike
198,vdtyho_00199,Judi with the genius IQ move only to pick up multiple ducks.
199,vdtyho_00200,I wonder if Ardal is getting flashbacks to my lovely horse
200,vdtyho_00201,Surreal with some sort of noodle incident
201,vdtyho_00202,Judi's vocals are >>>>>>
202,vdtyho_00203,No aubergine task? ffs.
203,vdtyho_00204,I think this has been my favourite episode of the season. Ending on a high
204,vdtyho_00205,"I will miss this cast so much, more than I have for several series :("
205,vdtyho_00206,Can't believe nobody caught on to the fact that Bridget already carried multiple ducks at a time when she took the basket off the bike
206,vdtyho_00207,I love how Ardal’s shit talking has become more ineffective over the series.
207,vdtyho_00208,a genuinely touching moment 2 seconds later You are a tosspot
208,vdtyho_00209,Boots n cats.
209,vdtyho_00210,"🎵We love you, Mr. T 🎵"
210,vdtyho_00211,What on earth is going on
211,vdtyho_00212,"I don’t know why, but suddenly I want to put an aubergine in my mouth"
212,vdtyho_00213,CONGRATS SOPHIE
213,vdtyho_00214,"This has been my favourite series ever - great tasks, fantastic lineup and some brilliant humour too. Already can’t wait for series 14 but will miss this bunch terribly"
214,vdtyho_00215,I was laughing so hard I was crying this episode. What a great series! I genuinely would have been thrilled no matter who won. They were all so great.
215,vdtyho_00216,The jump after monkey LMAO
216,vdtyho_00217,"Genius from Bridget, yet again"
217,vdtyho_00218,Judi is the agent of chaos I both aspire to know and be
218,vdtyho_00219,“Without moving the bowls”
219,vdtyho_00220,Such a shame for Bridget but I am crying at that remix 😂
220,vdtyho_00221,Ardal…what do you mean by ‘you put an aubergine in my mouth’
221,vdtyho_00222,"That's a first; a possible ""solo"" team task."
222,vdtyho_00223,"""We're gonna...put an aubergine in your mouth"""""
223,vdtyho_00224,Quick maths... Sophie won?
224,vdtyho_00225,CONGRATULATIONS SOPHIE!
225,vdtyho_00226,what I love about Taskmaster and British shows in general is that the diversity doesn't feel forced at all. As a white male i still am so happy a POC or in general a non Caucasian finally has won a series.
226,vdtyho_00227,I still have tears in my eyes from laughing. What a great episode.
227,vdtyho_00228,Was the live task a repeat of a task on Taskmaster NZ? I'm sure I've seen it before??
228,vdtyho_00229,House Dragon Queens
229,vdtyho_00230,
230,vdtyho_00231,"Maybe I missed it, but was there no individual task for one of the contestants that the others didn’t have to do? Either way, it was an awesome series and I loved all of the contestants"
231,vdtyho_00232,"I'd argue that was, in fact, balloon juice"
232,vdtyho_00233,Bridget got DNA wrong. Dock points!
233,vdtyho_00234,Sophie looked genuinely uncomfortable at Bridget's choice 😂
234,vdtyho_00235,Lol the others thought they could bullshit... Then along comes Judi
235,vdtyho_00236,Sophie and Judi with the Lychee juice
236,vdtyho_00237,Bridget!!!! A genius.
237,vdtyho_00238,"Love Bridget encouraging Alex, she’s lovely"
238,vdtyho_00239,I would die for Sophie Duker
239,vdtyho_00240,LMFAO THEY'RE JUST DRAWING ALEX
240,vdtyho_00241,I wonder if balloon juice is also thicker than water.
241,vdtyho_00242,Nahhhh Judi sounds amazing!
242,vdtyho_00243,I fucking love Bridget so much.
243,vdtyho_00244,"Man, they’re really laying into Bridget here."
244,vdtyho_00245,Phew! Sophie won! Thought Chris was going to Richard Herring it. Congratulations to her!
245,vdtyho_00246,"Haven't watched this episode yet since I'm in the states For the second series in a row, I accidentally spoiled the results to myself because I follow the official TM account on instagram..."
246,vdtyho_00247,Ardal with the jacket
247,vdtyho_00248,Gonna miss Sophie’s looks week to week!
248,vdtyho_00249,This might genuinely be one of my favourite tasks ever. The hilarity caused by Alex and the bike and the ways of obstructing him is epic!
249,vdtyho_00250,One of the funniest moments of the whole series right there
250,vdtyho_00251,No song task will ever seeing you do cool stuff
251,vdtyho_00252,Chris actually got a nice flow tho
252,vdtyho_00253,What the hell is going on
253,vdtyho_00254,BRIDGET'S LITTLE DANCE
254,vdtyho_00255,Bridget was a fantastic 3rd wheel 😂
255,vdtyho_00256,Ardal for once using his sass powers for good.
256,vdtyho_00257,Cast reveal must be next week then!
257,vdtyho_00258,I guess they're saving the S14 cast reveal for next week
258,vdtyho_00259,Well that was a brilliant series
259,vdtyho_00260,"Great selection of tasks for the final episode, I am so glad that several of them did something creative in the ducks task, that really elevated it to a finale worthy segment."
260,vdtyho_00261,Ok my husband is working late. Do you think it’s acceptable for me to watch the finale with you guys then pretend I haven’t seen it later and watch it again with him? I am a bigger fan than him and he can leave it days before he watches it whereas I love to watch it live.
261,vdtyho_00262,Judi's gone for some MGK shit here.
262,vdtyho_00263,Going off Bridgets reaction look like its LSD in the pipette
263,vdtyho_00264,Cream of Mushroom soup in the balloon.
264,vdtyho_00265,I thought the licking task would be the last time I would gag this season
265,vdtyho_00266,"Technically, Chris isn’t wrong with “Balloon Juice”"
266,vdtyho_00267,My eyes tell me the balloon is mushroom soup.
267,vdtyho_00268,Ardal is quite athletic for his age!
268,vdtyho_00269,How is Judy gonna do this task on her own? She's being separated from the rest...
269,vdtyho_00270,Bridget and Sophie. Both geniuses.
270,vdtyho_00271,"Ah, Judi, I love it. Shame she kind of broke the rules there, though, because that’s brilliant."
271,vdtyho_00272,"Judi is such good value, she's been fucking hilarious every week"
272,vdtyho_00273,One duck at a time is the new ‘without moving the fish bowl’.
273,vdtyho_00274,It's like Lee Mack taking the bog roll off the holder all over again!
274,vdtyho_00275,“Do not move the fishbowls” follow up track
275,vdtyho_00276,"I think that during the ducks & tricycle task, I'd stand in front of the tricycle, throw a net over Alex, then tie him up and complete the task by myself."
276,vdtyho_00277,One of the most one-sided team tasks of all time.
277,vdtyho_00278,Bridget’s whistling > Post Malone’s entire career
278,vdtyho_00279,“no but there’s rice at home”
279,vdtyho_00280,That was a banger
280,vdtyho_00281,Just me who has a huge crush on Bridget?
281,vdtyho_00282,SOPHIE!!!!!!!! 🥳
282,vdtyho_00283,Highest-scoring loser!
283,vdtyho_00284,So gutted Judy didn't win an episode
284,vdtyho_00285,The Duke of Taskerton!
285,vdtyho_00286,"That series was an absolute blast, going to really miss them all!"
286,vdtyho_00287,"Really enjoyed this one! It's probably just a coincidence, but I always find collectively the Winter series end up being better than the Spring ones, but this one was up there with my favourites!"
287,vdtyho_00288,Family Heirlooms is such an amazing prize task category.
288,vdtyho_00289,"Wait, do British people not say birth cert like in Ireland?"
289,vdtyho_00290,Balloon Juice!
290,vdtyho_00291,Shazam? Abracadabra? Monkey?
291,vdtyho_00292,Something tells me this series is going to finish without Judi getting a win
292,vdtyho_00293,Is Bridget not technically holding more than one duck at a time when she takes the basket?
293,vdtyho_00294,JUDI! So close. And yet so far.
294,vdtyho_00295,Holy fuck this task
295,vdtyho_00296,the house queens destroyed this task
296,vdtyho_00297,Chris's is also pretty good.
297,vdtyho_00298,Sophie wins the series!
298,vdtyho_00299,This really is the closest series of all time!
299,vdtyho_00300,Amazing winner of an amazing series
300,vdtyho_00301,What was on Alex's back at the end?
301,vdtyho_00302,No new cast announcement? 😔
302,vdtyho_00303,"Enjoyed that so, so much more than the last few series. Think that will go down as one of the very best lineups."
303,vdtyho_00304,"This was an amazing series. I lost some interest with the last 2 series, but this one was top notch (again). It's all in the guests."
304,vdtyho_00305,It's finale night. Will we see the new cast revealed?
305,vdtyho_00306,"Here's to the final week of utter shithousery. I'm not sure anything tonight will have me in stitches as much as Sausage Mixer, but who knows"
306,vdtyho_00307,"The final ""No way!"" of the series. Sad times."
307,vdtyho_00308,ARDALO IN THE RED JACKET
308,vdtyho_00309,That is the most insane and yet most Bridget thing
309,vdtyho_00310,BRIDGET I'M SCREAMING
310,vdtyho_00311,Wasn’t it Aisling who brought baby teeth as well?
311,vdtyho_00312,Bridget's faces in this task are ridiculous!
312,vdtyho_00313,You could say he's going to honk his Alex Horne...
313,vdtyho_00314,Genius from Bridget
314,vdtyho_00315,A classic task
315,vdtyho_00316,Judi “Lazy” Love should be a treat to watch in this challenge.
316,vdtyho_00317,Bridget is just A+ sometimes
317,vdtyho_00318,I bet Alex didn’t think this task though
318,vdtyho_00319,"love the use of tosspot by Greg there in that context, more demeaning than aggressive"
319,vdtyho_00320,ONE DUCK AT A TIME.
320,vdtyho_00321,My heart is breaking for Bridget.
321,vdtyho_00322,"She knew, even during the original scoring announcement. Taking it like a champ."
322,vdtyho_00323,There was an aubergine task???
323,vdtyho_00324,MAKE THIS THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IMMEDIATELY
324,vdtyho_00325,Judi on the vocals. Sophie on the vocals. Bridget on the bird
325,vdtyho_00326,Ardal DESTROYING another contestant.
326,vdtyho_00327,Bridget is my MVP solely for facial expressions.
327,vdtyho_00328,Ardal's looks like Greg's Blue Ted.
328,vdtyho_00329,i love the colouring in they’re trying to do
329,vdtyho_00330,Am I going crazy or was that studio task also used in NZ S2?
330,vdtyho_00331,The duck task was amazing - one of my favourites!
331,vdtyho_00332,the last time we’ll hear nooo waiiiii on a new episode 😭
332,vdtyho_00333,Chris has dressed up for the final! Wearing a buttonup instead of a polo shirt.
333,vdtyho_00334,i love you sophie
334,vdtyho_00335,Rice cookers rule TBH
335,vdtyho_00336,Ardal needling already 😂😂😂😂😂
336,vdtyho_00337,THE SQUEAKY JACKET!!
337,vdtyho_00338,That’s the most Bridget thing EVER
338,vdtyho_00339,"I need Bridget's pipetting, and then her reaction to that, as a GIF. Please."
339,vdtyho_00340,I fucking knew it was Mushroom soup.
340,vdtyho_00341,"""It tastes like ass. Is it Dr Pepper?"" Wow! Shots fired!"
341,vdtyho_00342,Judi like a lost lamb looking for Alex
342,vdtyho_00343,Excellent throw from Ardal! That was very satisfying.
343,vdtyho_00344,No way Judi is running for shit
344,vdtyho_00345,Yes Bridget.
345,vdtyho_00346,Fucking up his chain is great. Sadly it's a DQ for multiple duck touching.
346,vdtyho_00347,That was an all-time best task.
347,vdtyho_00348,When will TM UK replicate the TM NZ diss rap…..
348,vdtyho_00349,David Correos areas right HERE
349,vdtyho_00350,Bridget bringing a yoko ono vibe to this event
350,vdtyho_00351,Water Diamonds vs The House Queens. Immaculate.
351,vdtyho_00352,"My lovely Taskmaster, running through the fields..."
352,vdtyho_00353,Your Your team juice? Ok with the aubergine in my mouth things I realise now this was intentional
353,vdtyho_00354,"Well, that was disturbing!"
354,vdtyho_00355,Oh shit Champion Of Champions starts right away?! Awesome.
355,vdtyho_00356,Judi served
356,vdtyho_00357,"Scoring seems fair, although worth noting there were only 2 boys to make a multi-track song. The House Queens? Generational."
357,vdtyho_00358,Ardal’s nod of approval towards his own drawing
358,vdtyho_00359,He got the red jacket!
359,vdtyho_00360,has sophie won?!?! hard won series so close chris! happy for sophie though
360,vdtyho_00361,One of the best series imo!!!! If not the best
361,vdtyho_00362,"What a fantastic final episode. This season has been surprisingly brilliant, can't wait for the next one!"
362,vdtyho_00363,"Judi’s gonna win guys, can’t wait!"
363,vdtyho_00364,"Could do a murder and plant her kids deoxyribonucleic acid so you get away with it, not a bad prize."
364,vdtyho_00365,In fairness we do shorten it to cert. Birth cert. Marriage cert. Junior Cert. Leaving Cert.
365,vdtyho_00366,Are we expecting a cast announcement at the end? We’ve had them the last couple of seasons at least
366,vdtyho_00367,"According to my 11-year-old cousin, liquids are ""lickwids"", with the definition being ""when you lick things""."
367,vdtyho_00368,Chris is very underdressed in the studio compared to the others
368,vdtyho_00369,"That balloon juice, fucking hell."
369,vdtyho_00370,I predict Sophie pops the balloon over Alex.
370,vdtyho_00371,Will we get a season 14 cast reveal tonight?
371,vdtyho_00372,"Why, why, are they popping the balloon?!"
372,vdtyho_00373,"""It tastes like ass. Is it Doctor Pepper?"""
373,vdtyho_00374,It’s leg day for Alex.
374,vdtyho_00375,Adding this to the list of tasks that should be an Olympic game
375,vdtyho_00376,I cannot wait to see Judi do this.
376,vdtyho_00377,“architect” what is happening in this man’s mind 😂
377,vdtyho_00378,"Brilliant, both of them"
378,vdtyho_00379,Do we think this is the task where Alex broke his hand? Based on that lead in?
379,vdtyho_00380,Can't wait for the ending of that to feature on a taskmaster out of context YouTube video
380,vdtyho_00381,That can't be right.
381,vdtyho_00382,Getting “without moving the fishbowls” vibes…
382,vdtyho_00383,"I...feel the girls track might be significantly better than the boys, oh dear."
383,vdtyho_00384,omg did they do a solo team task and they’re gunna show it?
384,vdtyho_00385,Wait Judi is actually really good!!!
385,vdtyho_00386,THEYRE KILLING IT OMG
386,vdtyho_00387,Sophie Ducker!
387,vdtyho_00388,"I did have a thought to stamp on a big duck in the hope of splitting it, then stuffing it full of little ones, then I'd only be holding the big duck (technically, as all great TM workarounds are!) But, I bet I'd have taken longer and managed fewer than all of them, hopefully without getting carried away, having a tiny duck in each hand and getting disqualified!"
388,vdtyho_00389,The red jacket looks nice on Ardel
389,vdtyho_00390,Fucking hell Sophie.
390,vdtyho_00391,What the fuck Judi. Rofl
391,vdtyho_00392,Queen of Bullshitting.
392,vdtyho_00393,Love the way he says “b*gger”
393,vdtyho_00394,It looks like a dog's been sick 🤢
394,vdtyho_00395,I’m going to miss this lot
395,vdtyho_00396,"It's deoxyribonucleic acid, Bridget. Don't get cocky on my man Ardal. :D"
396,vdtyho_00397,“It tastes like ass. Is it Dr Pepper?” I agree with Sophie!
397,vdtyho_00398,Incredible Sophie.
398,vdtyho_00399,NOO BRIDGET
399,vdtyho_00400,Six? Holy shit.
400,vdtyho_00401,I love how they clearly all just decided to draw Alex. Need to see their art in image form.
401,vdtyho_00402,Ardal and Chris look like a pair of cheeky little lads planning this song
402,vdtyho_00403,I can't wait to see Judi sing
403,vdtyho_00404,this is where sophie wins the series
404,vdtyho_00405,That was actually pretty good
405,vdtyho_00406,Give the House Queens 50 points each!
406,vdtyho_00407,Sophie has won it (unless she comes last and chris comes first in this task)!
407,vdtyho_00408,very reminiscent of the schizophrenic or alzheimers portraits
408,vdtyho_00409,"Sophie's, with the LOVE U, is actually pretty good."
409,vdtyho_00410,"Sophie already won, so no need for that strained energy explanation"
410,vdtyho_00411,Sophie has won the series
411,vdtyho_00412,Absolutely fantastic series this time around. Great assortment of contestants.
412,vdtyho_00413,ARDAL DRIP ARDAL DRIP
413,vdtyho_00414,The style on this one - from Ardal's jacket to Sophie's overall look
414,vdtyho_00415,"""You can do whatever you want with the balloon."" Christ Alex don't tempt them"
415,vdtyho_00416,How do you get lemon and strawberry from the same liquid?!
416,vdtyho_00417,"Barkeep, I'll have your finest pint of balloon juice please!"
417,vdtyho_00418,"Give it up for [Chris Ramsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ramsey_(comedian)),!"
418,vdtyho_00419,"""Liquidised prawn cocktail crisps"""
419,vdtyho_00420,Again with the niche fetishes
420,vdtyho_00421,i’m going to miss judi’s bullshit. “that’s what vomit is” 😂
421,vdtyho_00422,"Ah, old Sophie Ducker."
422,vdtyho_00423,"I’m guessing “ducky” is a magic word, bd side it was on some of the ducks."
423,vdtyho_00424,They are saving Judi for last
424,vdtyho_00425,Bridget is an absolute icon
425,vdtyho_00426,I'm going to kill that fucking bingo fox.
426,vdtyho_00427,Judi and Alex are such a comedic duo
427,vdtyho_00428,BRIDGET NO.
428,vdtyho_00429,Noooo Bridget fucked it!
429,vdtyho_00430,Oh Bridget… why
430,vdtyho_00431,"One day, somebody is going to deliberately not say 'your time starts now', but then end up forgetting to say it completely, leaving to disqualification as technically their time never started."
431,vdtyho_00432,is ardal’s gunna end up sounding like my lovely horse
432,vdtyho_00433,Why Ardal is sweating so hard
433,vdtyho_00434,"Title, drink"
434,vdtyho_00435,"Oh no, it's terrible!"
435,vdtyho_00436,What a banger! 10/10
436,vdtyho_00437,"Oh, hey, another TM NZ task."
437,vdtyho_00438,COME ON DUCKIE
438,vdtyho_00439,First time a contestant hasn't won an episode in a season?
439,vdtyho_00440,JUDI 😭😭😭😭
440,vdtyho_00441,I’m so excited! The series is so close as well.
441,vdtyho_00442,i’m not ready for it to be over 😭 i’ll miss them all so much
442,vdtyho_00443,I wonder if Ardal's jacket squeaks...
443,vdtyho_00444,Sophie you have a shot at winning Is what I had typed until she sold Greg so well
444,vdtyho_00445,Birthcert.
445,vdtyho_00446,Alex’s face
446,vdtyho_00447,"Awh! Love Bridget's reaction to seeing the task. The ""Oooooh"" and little clap."
447,vdtyho_00448,My new album name: Smells Like Potato
448,vdtyho_00449,I can’t believe it’s already a break
449,vdtyho_00450,To everyone asking about the S14 line up: I don't think it will be tonight. There would have been some kind of noise made about it.
450,vdtyho_00451,For one thing Dr. Pepper is delicious...
451,vdtyho_00452,Judi Love the bullshit queen
452,vdtyho_00453,DUCKS. So many ducks.
453,vdtyho_00454,DUCK TASK DUCK TASK

460,vdtyho_00461,Oh Bridget
461,vdtyho_00462,Bridget you were SO CLOSE
462,vdtyho_00463,Bridget nooooooo
463,vdtyho_00464,Oh Judi. Absolutely brilliant.
464,vdtyho_00465,“It's totally fine!🙃”

470,vdtyho_00471,Sophie has won the series right? She’s killed this episode and I think she was already ahead
471,vdtyho_00472,Surely Sophie has won
472,vdtyho_00473,Congrats Sophie!
473,vdtyho_00474,"Wait, did i just hear henning wehn is on taskmaster?!"
474,vdtyho_00475,"Here we go, here we go, here we go!"
475,vdtyho_00476,Let's gooo
476,vdtyho_00477,"I love overhyped, yelling Alex"
477,vdtyho_00478,
478,vdtyho_00479,Chris getting it that quickly has me questioning how he spends his weeknights...
479,vdtyho_00480,The purple goat from that Strongbow advert has the same energy as the Taskmaster himself. I can't quite put my finger on how.
480,vdtyho_00481,Alex has such a unique face.
481,vdtyho_00482,ARDAL JUST STRAIGHT IN THERE WITH THE POP AND FACE IN IT
482,vdtyho_00483,"Sophie with the sly dig: ""it tastes like ass! Is ait Dr Pepper?"""
483,vdtyho_00484,I love the attitude from ardal lmao
484,vdtyho_00485,"If Judi doesn’t win tonight, I’m throwing hands."
485,vdtyho_00486,Of course Alex has a list!
486,vdtyho_00487,"Well, at least Bridgette isn’t overextending herself."
487,vdtyho_00488,Oh noooo. Judi is not winning.
488,vdtyho_00489,judi is going to be absolutely shit and i cant wait
489,vdtyho_00490,Fucking hell Judi
490,vdtyho_00491,Can someone reply to this please? On my phone the episode discussion works much better from the view when I get a notification
491,vdtyho_00492,OOOOOH.
492,vdtyho_00493,Bridget fucked it.
493,vdtyho_00494,It's fishbowls all over again!
494,vdtyho_00495,Ah! Bridget got knocked out too!
495,vdtyho_00496,Was there a task that only one contestant had to complete in this series???
496,vdtyho_00497,Think they should have been given a full hour tbh
497,vdtyho_00498,A SONG TASK?!
498,vdtyho_00499,ITS THE DISSTRACK ONE FROM NZ
499,vdtyho_00500,Judy Love again with the episode title! 😍
500,vdtyho_00501,Will they release these albums?
501,vdtyho_00502,:D
502,vdtyho_00503,Looking forward to the House Queens remixes
503,vdtyho_00504,Quality final task. Here we go!
504,vdtyho_00505,Bridget's is good.
505,vdtyho_00506,Judi had the hoop earrings! Pity that they're where her eyes should be...
506,vdtyho_00507,Sophie's won
0,vj5066_00001,Please stop it with the cheering against people. Thanks.
1,vj5066_00002,"Loved every contestant, they all did awesome. My biggest gripe was definitely that A: CoC needs to at least 2 episodes…So lame for it to be only 1. And B: Very weird choice of a live task, not just for the bizarre “1 winner” scoring but also because we already did a prize task nearly identical to this, but I understand if it’s easy to run out of games. The prize/recorded tasks were fantastic though and these contestants seriously brought their A-game."
2,vj5066_00003,The real winner was me because I got another episode with Kerry Godliman in it.
3,vj5066_00004,"Really fking lame they don't take the opportunity to make these into a full 10 part series. I mean maybe the contestants aren't willing to do it all again, but either way 1 episode is just not enough. Lame. The scoring of the last crap challenge ruined the episode too tbh. Liza is the champion in my heart."
0,vskti3_00001,"I really enjoyed the egg task, especially Josh’s success at getting them down followed by the absolutely INSANE decision to not remove them from the bucket or even check the bucket, before going back for more. I also really liked the crème brûlée task with Chris’ dramatic failure. I do feel like both of those sequences would have been edited differently in UKTM to highlight the dramatic successes / failures. But a good start!"
1,vskti3_00002,
2,vskti3_00003,Is there a thread for ep2?
3,vskti3_00004,"This episode's studio segments felt extremely subdued.. I liked the tasks themselves (mostly) and enjoyed the different solutions all the contestants gave, but I felt the studio was really lacking in energy. I hope it's just first episode jitters and they'll all get accustomed to the other contestants. I can't help but compare this season to season 2, in which EVERYONE (but Jeremy) really jelled with each other (but Jeremy) and had such great charisma (but Jeremy). Here's hoping lightning strikes thrice."
4,vskti3_00005,I genuinely thought the audience was virtual since they sounded so disinterested and quiet. I thought there were a bunch of really funny moments but the episode could've been elevated much more by a better audience.
5,vskti3_00006,I feel like this episode has been severely hampered by the audience being very flat
6,vskti3_00007,"NZ Context: In the egg task, Paul Williams asks Paul Ego what supermarket he’s shopping at. Paul Ego voices Stickman, a cartoon stick figure that’s the mascot for Pak’N’Save, a “low-cost” supermarket."
7,vskti3_00008,"Did anyone notice that David Correos has been added to the ""Additional Writing"" credit?"
8,vskti3_00009,The golf task is really taking advantage of that huge area they have. Also the reveal at the end was great.
9,vskti3_00010,YAY CHRIS WON A SPORT!!
10,vskti3_00011,"Loved Chris's callback to Brynley's ""I'm a girl scout, not a nazi"""
11,vskti3_00012,Audience is a bit flat imo
12,vskti3_00013,"Absolutely in love with Kura- she seems like she’s having the complete time of her life. Her excitement is immediately infectious. The whole panel gives me UK S4 vibes, they seem like a pretty supportive bunch as opposed to the cutthroat chaotic energies of NZ2. Excited to see more… hopefully with a bit more of an enthusiastic audience!"
13,vskti3_00014,"Once again TM NZ has top tier tasks all the way down. Holy shit. Also I love Paul's unofficial catchphrase ""And you're happy with that?"""
14,vskti3_00015,"Multiple literal laugh out loud moments. Following the god-tier season 2 was always going to be hard, but this is a great start. Maybe my favorite ever Jeremy moment giving Paul Ego 0 points on the prize task. ETA: everyone perfectly understanding and executing the ""make the noise from the previous person"" part of the live task except for Paul Ego was great."
15,vskti3_00016,"Chris has useless gay energy and I love that for him. Josh Thomson has the same look, vibe, mannerisms and sense of humour of someone I know irl and it terrifies me lol. Justine Smith is the most relatable person on earth. Kura gives Laura/Brynley (from past seasons) vibes. Paul (Ego) is just fucking weird. Idk if the contestants have so much chemistry with each other yet but it's looking good! Paul (Williams) in the last task defo gave me a laugh"
16,vskti3_00017,NZ always delivers on the tasks. The golf task particularly was GOAT-tier.
17,vskti3_00018,Already loving this cast after just a couple of tasks. Jeremy is finally invoking more of his Newsboy persona and I'm now fully sold on him as the Taskmaster. This is going to be a great season!
18,vskti3_00019,"Josh, wow, that creme brulee crack was outstanding"
19,vskti3_00020,They decided to record the studio task(s) in the room with the loudest echo in New Zealand!
20,vskti3_00021,Paul Ego is following in the proud tradition of Leigh Hart and Matt Heath by coming across like a middle-aged uncle trying to make conversation with the teenagers at a family barbecue.
21,vskti3_00022,Josh's crack was outstanding. Showing some early brilliance. Chris not doing as well as I expected
22,vskti3_00023,My biggest disappointment is that they didn't continue Laura's floating Brussels Sprouts gag. It'd have been hilarious if they hung the bucket back up for the season.
23,vskti3_00024,I don’t think Paul understood the final task
24,vskti3_00025,The makeup artist for the studio shows did Jeremy dirty and skipped his ears.
25,vskti3_00026,
26,vskti3_00027,"Spoiler in the next episode clips! Kura, Josh and Justine are a team, so Paul and Chris are the other. What a combination"
27,vskti3_00028,"As with any new season comes a new opening sequence, and with any opening sequence comes my obsession and relentless intrigue with one of the clips shown, this time it's ""Hi I'm Paul Williams"" from someone who clearly isn't Paul Williams. I cannot wait to see the context for that clip!"
28,vskti3_00029,Loved the Hitler Youth reference from Chris
29,vskti3_00030,I think Jeremy forgot he asked for three bottles!
30,vskti3_00031,Already looking forward to the season! The lineup is looking solid. The audio is weird tho. Maybe it's always been that way and I'm just readjusting to the show again.
31,vskti3_00032,Have we gone back to season one level lighting for the studio portion? Something seems off.
32,vskti3_00033,"Some very strong tasks as usual coming out of New Zealand. The creme brulee task I thought wasn't going to be very good based on reading of the task but I can admit I was wrong based on the watching of the task. The others you can tell from the wording were going to be good, the golf task you knew the wording of ""it's hole"" meant you were gonna have to find the hole or fight it out in the studio after digging your own and labelling up. The ultimate reveal at the end was classic taskmaster. The first task I was thinking constantly, eggs don't crack if they land on grass - we learnt this back in series 1 UK - not sure I'd be game to test it from that height and with the added risk they'd hit each other on the way down. As for Paul's (contestant) hairline cracked egg that, I would have said it wasn't Paul's (TM assistant) decision to make on if it was cracked and he should have deferred to Jeremy on if it counted or not. Not completely sold on the prize task scoring but an improvement on some of my disagreements I've had with Jeremy's choices in previous years, so I'll reserve judgement for a few more episodes."
33,vskti3_00034,"Question for the science/egg nerds out there: I’ve learned from Taskmaster UK that eggs aren’t supposed to crack when they drop onto grass. For the egg task, could you have just shaken the pole and had them all land on the grass relatively safely? Was it the act of them hitting non-grass things that caused breakage? Or is the height too great for it to matter? Am I a taskmaster genius or idiot? All I know for certain is that my crush on Paul Williams rages on."
34,vskti3_00035,Having a Pak'nSave ad in the break is a bit trippy...
35,vskti3_00036,Kura i giving me Mel Giedroyc vibes I love it
36,vskti3_00037,Ok the clip of Chris running to the flag needs to made into a gif!
37,vskti3_00038,Wonderful start to a season. I feel like Paul E was shafted in the creme brûlée task for making a poo joke .
38,vskti3_00039,for this season can we refer to the Pauls as Ego and Williams or its going to get confusing. Or Paul Williams as P-Willy.
39,vskti3_00040,P-Willy!
40,vskti3_00041,Something I love about TMNZ is the no fuss cuts to ad breaks. I really don't care for them in the UK version and think the cut into a lot of studio time.
41,vskti3_00042,"Pretty good start. Everyone seems to have an established character already. Since Paul picked up the whole apparatus at the end, I was thinking that someone could have carried the pole to their balcony and dumped it out there, maybe after creating a soft space for it. Or they could take it to the pond if it's not too far. The advantages this property has over UK are numerous. Of course carrying the pole is perilous in itself. Chris and Josh both had an ingenious system but alas failed. The creme brulee task had a bit of lack of imagination on the approaches what with two contestants flinging random stuff off the balcony. I wanted someone to sledgehammer it from a moving vehicle or something. The catapult was great though, and the slow motion miss was cool. The golf reveal was awesome. When they spotted it I was thinking they'd pick up the hole and bring it to the ball but they all brought the ball to the hole."
42,vskti3_00043,"""You ever sucked a mannequin's toes? Hell of a thrill, mate."" I'm glad to have more Taskmaster to look forward to each week. I usually wait for the whole season of NZ to air so I can binge it at once, but I really needed to treat myself today. Seems like a fun group of contestants, but I'm still getting to know their personalities (Josh Thomson seems chill, though). I don't know if it's just me, but Jeremy Wells seemed stricter than usual this episode. Or maybe it's just because Greg has been getting softer? By the way, this is the happiest Hitler youth I've ever seen."
43,vskti3_00044,Jeremy back to his patented nonsense scoring system.
44,vskti3_00045,Paul's in good form. With Alex also having one of his best seasons is it finally the year of the Taskmaster's Assistant?
45,vskti3_00046,"That promo at the end looked incredible, lots to look forward to!!"
46,vskti3_00047,Paul Ego slotting perfectly into the older contestant doesn't understand the task in the final live task was mwah perfection
47,vskti3_00048,Everyone is delightful but I can tell Josh will be my favourite.
48,vskti3_00049,"I didn't know any of these people but already loving it! 'Am I the spider?' is now kept company by 'Are you the hole?'. Also, there's something so attractive about Paul Williams. Wasn't expecting it but I'm rooting for Paul to do well, after he didn't understand the live task xD Also surprised to see Jeremy make the TM role his own with each season. Looks like he's going to nake Paul be the Hugh Dennis of this season."
49,vskti3_00050,2nd time someone dressed as Hitler Youth. 2nd time someone used a Roman catapult for a task.
50,vskti3_00051,Kura and her increasingly bigger vices lololol
51,vskti3_00052,"Just watched it. Pretty good, the only contestant I think I had seen before this was Josh Thomson on a bit of 'Have you been paying attention' which I checked out on youtube after TM NZ season 1 & 2. (although I might've spotted Paul and forgotten) The energy felt a little lacking in this episode, maybe because it's the first episode of the season. Something in the editing made it sound like there was barely any audience there at all. Task-wise pretty solid as usual, nothing too wacky, which I'm sure we'll see soon (the next time trailer has a task that I'm really looking forward too). I wonder if the crème brulee task was inspired by Lou Sanders bringing one in as her 'best burstable item', could easily be a coincidence though."
52,vskti3_00053,
53,vskti3_00054,Was waiting for a Pak 'n' Save reference from Paul - almost got one!
54,vskti3_00055,Jeremy really hates Paul
55,vskti3_00056,Disappointed Josh Thomson didn't get a Roman outfit like Matt Heath did tbh1
56,vskti3_00057,"Good first episode! I don't have a favourite yet, but I already like all of them. I know this meme is old and overdone, but I couldn't resist making one for this episode. https://imgflip.com/i/6lzzzv"
57,vskti3_00058,So you are telling me the grass in New Zealand is sharp enough to burst balloons on immediate impact but somehow eggs land just fine on them? Edit: Grammar
58,vskti3_00059,OK s3 here we go. Levels at hyped
59,vskti3_00060,All of the tasks were good! I'm not IMMEDIATELY attached to any contestant but we got loooots of time for that to change.
60,vskti3_00061,"Great to have TMNZ back! And immediately the catching egg and golf tasks are fantastic. Think Josh and Paul were my early standouts. Paul saying he was going to “heather mccarthy” it was my line of the episode, think he was scored unfairly in that one too. But hilarious how quickly he gave up on the golf task. Excited to see how this one goes"
61,vskti3_00062,I hadn’t looked up the contestants beforehand so was very happy to see two previous Guy Montgomery Guy Mont-Spelling bee contestants!
62,vskti3_00063,The make up matching … so distracting
63,vskti3_00064,"I don't know about this season, seems like it's going to be a very average season. This is coming from someone who thought NZ season 2 is the 2nd best season across all series (uk s13 just unseated it). First off, I think Jeremy Wells is a terrible taskmaster. He's not charismatic, funny, or clever. In this episode I think he was the lowest energy I've ever seen him. Paul is great, I like him better than Alex, but Jeremy is pretty shit. In this episode he was even more shit. The cast, they're not bad but no real standouts. I have the funny feeling Josh Thompson is just going to completely run away with it. I hope I'm wrong and it was just a bad audience, but from that first episode I feel like it's just going to be a forgettable season."
64,vskti3_00065,"Do people not know that birds have evolved so their eggs land safely on grass if dropped? The best move is to gently tip eggs off one at a time, you'll get 11 or 12."
65,vskti3_00066,"Josh oh Josh, that was tragic"
66,vskti3_00067,Can't believe the episode wasn't titled 'Butter Knife'
67,vskti3_00068,"We get at least Suurmestari (FIN), the original TM, and Swedish Bäst i Test here in Finland, I am very appalled that TMNZ is not available legally. This first episode was a riot! Good to see the NZ John Cena back!"
68,vskti3_00069,Finally caught up. Very enjoyable considering I don't know a single contestant. Perhaps there will be a crack the tiramisu task one day!
69,vskti3_00070,The countdown is on!
70,vskti3_00071,Josh may be smarter than I have previously given him credit for. I’m intrigued to see if the rest of the season proves me wrong or if he was just lucky first up.
71,vskti3_00072,"So far off to a good start I think, Paul is my opening favorite with Kura either a big winner or big loser."
0,vy32dq_00001,Sorry it's late for tricked by New Zealand being so far in the future from me.
1,vy32dq_00002,"This is probably my favourite episode thus far. The pi task is something I do hope the UK version replicates (with equal hilarious results), and it was doubly hilarious from the fact that Chris had this amazing mnemonic for the decimal numbers, but forgot the leading digit and thus ended up in last place; and the fact that Justine utterly and hilariously misinterpreted the task and thought ""recite"" simply meant ""to read"" and not ""to repeat from memory."" Also, ""shid."" Just so much ""shid""!"
2,vy32dq_00003,TIL: That thing is called Zorb
3,vy32dq_00004,"Hmmmmm not really feeling this cast, particularly Paul, but most of them have had their moments. I guess there was no way they could reach the heights of the three friends again, particularly not so soon after S2, but we desperately need some smarter comedic voices on here - everyone's a little ""mainstream radio host"" this season, Chris aside. That said, the pi task was great, and NZ TM still develop really good task concepts, even if this group don't always make the most of them."
4,vy32dq_00005,"I've really enjoyed Josh and Justine so far in particular. It's been good! I agree with the comments about two memory tasks in a row being a strange choice, but the visual of them being crammed into the shed was funny."
5,vy32dq_00006,"Everyone's faces when Justine started reading numbers, shocked, but sympathetic, was such a real moment. And the entire Chris's attempt will probably be one of my all time favourites. Artful, dramatic, wholesome 😗👌"
6,vy32dq_00007,"Oh now this is great! I thought episode one was good, but not amazing. But this episode had me almost crying laughing multiple times. Sauce tits, josh kicking the woman in half and then the “not a real woman, actually I don’t want to get into it,” the pi task! Also the sushi train has to be the best prize task entry in ages. I love tmnz"
7,vy32dq_00008,Honestly Paul's sauce tits thing felt a bit too try hard for humor
8,vy32dq_00009,"For the prize task, I thought of an old book: the smell and feel of an old book, the distinctive crackle of the pages as they turn for sound, and of course the sight of the pages. But what old book can also activate the sense of taste? My prize submission, therefore: a plane ticket to Michigan to visit one of the last four existing copies of ""Shadows from the Walls of Death"" by Dr. Robert C. Kedzie. I hear the taste is to die for."
9,vy32dq_00010,"Honestly, miles better than the premiere. Having a more electric audience helps, but you could tell immediately at the prize task that the cast is getting more comfortable with their roles- every task had moments that had me cackling. The physical comedy of Chris going into the shed when he lost the live task, and Justine following him, was absolute perfection. One of the key things I get from watching these that I really wish UK Taskmaster still did - and I'm absolutely parroting a popular opinion here - is actually cutting back to the studio and showing the panel's reactions. Like what made the last NZ season's panel so great, this group interacts a lot while watching the tasks and it creates a fantastic environment and just feeds into that chemistry so well."
10,vy32dq_00011,For the non-kiwis Shortland Street is a super popular soap drama over here Jaycar Electronics is a branded electrical store Theres a fish poster in every shid in NZ
11,vy32dq_00012,"I mean... sauce tits. The tasks have been brilliant here. Loved the cheersing of the cow. Paul Ego followed Johnny Vegas' trend of falling over without nothing near. Chris's meltdown at the pi task was genuinely incredible, especially with how genius his dance recital was. Jeremy is growing in his role as TM too"
12,vy32dq_00013,"Good episode! Throughout Chris practicing the pi task I kept saying to myself that there’s no way he’s missed 3… there’s just no way… and well he managed to do it 😂. Josh‘s “if you need drama, kick a woman” is probably going to be one of my favorite taskmaster quotes. Also, Jeremy was fantastic this episode."
13,vy32dq_00014,I CANT BELIEVE THE FUSH POSTER WAS IN THE SHID
14,vy32dq_00015,"My only criticism of this episode is that it felt weird to have back to back memorization tasks? Like, the shid task was a bit of an anticlimax after the pi task."
15,vy32dq_00016,The callback to Rose Matafeo and her shid fish poster is just 👨‍🍳🤌💋 Especially fun as a Non-kiwi to listen to everyone say “shid” so often.
16,vy32dq_00017,"Honestly can't believe the soap opera won over GAY MURDER and SAUCE TITS, sorry but it was boring"
17,vy32dq_00018,"Genuinely don't know how to feel about the Sauce Tits moment. I know I was laughing- really hard- but I have no idea why. As for the Pi task, Paul still doing the high-five ""5s"" in rhythm with Chris Parker, even though he was fuckin' fuming and mid meltdown, was quite nice of him. He seems like a good dude."
18,vy32dq_00019,Episode was insane. Josh is way more competent than I thought he would be. Love that this season everyone has had a chance to shine. How often does Episode title come from same person back to back. The dramatic exit was Justines strongest task so far . No idea what Paul was thinking with Sauce tits. P-Willys double pants was gold.
19,vy32dq_00020,Paul falling over due to “milky crocs” is just incredible
20,vy32dq_00021,"I totally knew what was coming with Chris's attempt at the pi task, but it still made me die laughing. As others have said, Gay Murder should have won the drama task. Hyped for some Acaster-Wang-Gilbert level of team chaos from Josh, Justine, and Kura."
21,vy32dq_00022,"I forget the exact wording of the milk task, but I was wondering if they could’ve taken the syntactically ambiguous Richard Osman approach Down by the dock, there is a cow (which doesn’t necessarily have to stay down there), you could bring the cow up to the Zorb, it would never leave its starting area, bosh"
22,vy32dq_00023,"With David Correos providing writing for the show now, there’s NO WAY he didn’t come up with the idea of using a Zorb in a task."
23,vy32dq_00024,"As soon as I saw the shed I thought to myself ""if there isn't a fish poster in it..."""
24,vy32dq_00025,"Chris' ""oh my God! this is reminding me of being in the closet"" comment inside the zorb is so underrated"
25,vy32dq_00026,"Finally starting to get in the groove with this cast. Some stand-out moments for me: Josh with the mannequin: ""She's not a real woman... I mean, all women are—I don't want to get into it."" Chris's massacre and suicide by Supersoaker. Paul's slow-motion sauce tits, obviously. Justine: ""I'm gonna smash that pie in your face."" Followed by Chris overturning the pie on the table. I think the series finally took a turn where they start turning on the TM assistant, à la Alex Horne. Also, love the moan (Kura?) that emerged from the locked shed during the live task. Solid episode, overall."
26,vy32dq_00027,"Overall a good episode. As an outsider to the NZ comedy scene, I'm finding this bunch a bit harder to crack than the series 2 bunch - except for Justine, none of them really stand out personality-wise yet. But there are plenty of episodes to go. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't get the point of locking the shed in the studio task. Of course, it's nice the see the fish poster, which has already achieved fame abroad, get a moment of recognition in its native country (after the cameo last season). The dramatic exit and team tasks were both solid tasks that were a lot of fun to watch. I wonder if the pi task was one of the cases where a task was designed as a tiebreaker then made into a main task by someone doing something unexpected. If everyone had just done the task as assigned without a meltdown, it would have been pretty boring. Luckily, the pair of meltdowns made this my favourite task of the episode."
27,vy32dq_00028,Given Josh's performance in the second task I can only wait for his selection to the all blacks
28,vy32dq_00029,"I'm so glad that they divided the teams like this - I was worried it'd be youngs vs olds like in UKS9, but luckily they gave Josh his David Badiel. Big ups to Chris in the pi task for making Paul Williams laugh, I can't remember any times (excluding the studio) that he has."
29,vy32dq_00030,"Hahaha, great episode. That Justine one not reading the task properly was brilliant. And then Chris just absolutely ruining it too. Paul proper decking it on the Zorb task was an oof, would have knocked the wind out of me! Disappointed sauce tits didn't get more though. Kura and Josh seem like they'll go the distance. Chris is one of Pee Willies mates, Paul is the standard old guy, and Justine did make me laugh with her ineptness. Also, Kura is younger than I thought."
30,vy32dq_00031,Much better episode. The cast has warmed up and someone must be out in the audience with a cattleprod. Good. Now back to playing with my sauce tits in the shid.
31,vy32dq_00032,"Wonder if you could've argued for a loophole in the pi task. Seemed like there were very few restrictions so you could've gotten a second piece of paper and written down digits, or maybe even just start saying ""1"" over and over and argue you've got 1 in 10 of the digits right after the ones you remembered. Seems like NZ hasn't had their loophole abuser yet to shore these things up (or maybe they just cut the restrictions from broadcast because it was an upgraded tiebreak where nobody bothered to try to cheat). It's also clear to me as an American that ""recite"" has a different connotation for the Kiwis because I definitely would've thought Justine's attempt counted. EDIT: Justine's actually wouldn't count since the task said the attempt started in 10 minutes and her recital all occurred prior to that."
32,vy32dq_00033,"Well this episode was a step up from the first of the season. The energy levels seemed higher and we got a few more crazy performances from contestants. A fun prize task, I liked how they all seemed to focus on food they try to BS their way to include sound and touch. Dramatic Exit being the opposite to series 9 dramatic entrance was lovely, NZ TM really knows how to borrow tasks without repeating themselves. Fun team task too. Wasn't exactly the team I expected but I think I like that more. I was hoping Kura would be one to go in the zorb and was delighted when she did. I wonder if the pie/pi task was partially inspired by David Correos mentioning he was going to buy pie in the last season, or if pie is such a really popular dessert in New Zealand. This task would've also been perfect for me as a while back I decided to memorise the first 20 digits of pi so I would have a headstart. The live task was also a great reference to UK TM with the shid with the poster of fish again from series 9. Maybe not the best task to put with the same episode as the pi task though since both were about memorisation. But yeah, solid episode, the only negative I can think of is the badly edited 'oooh' from the audience near the end which was 5 seconds too early."
33,vy32dq_00034,"Honestly being a kiwi most of the stand up is garbage here, they are really good at picking who would work in this format. Someone said earlier that it was going to be hard to match last TMNZ chaos but these guys are giving it a very good go"
34,vy32dq_00035,The pi task had me dieing laughing
0,w3grnl_00001,Ep4 discussion?
1,w3grnl_00002,I feel like this set of contestants doesn’t have great chemistry together like past seasons.
2,w3grnl_00003,forgot to mention I loved that the lazer eye kiwi flag got a mention.
3,w3grnl_00004,The flag task is ond of the best I've seen was laughing so hard
4,w3grnl_00005,Haven’t finished the episode yet but just want to jump in to say this is probably Jeremy’s best episode so far The hitler riff at the start was fun and him going on about being sad for the nz marketing team and Justine not knowing her grandfather were quality jokes
5,w3grnl_00006,"I don’t understand why people are so hung up on how Greg would score something vs. Jeremy. Greg has made some absolutely cooked scoring decisions in the past, I don’t think his system needs to be exported."
6,w3grnl_00007,"My goodness, non-kiwis will have absolutely no idea who or what Paul Ego was referencing with his Marilyn Monroe Happy Birthday bit. 😄"
7,w3grnl_00008,"I like how plausible and ridiculous Chris's fictional ""get the closest to the sun"" task was."
8,w3grnl_00009,why is chris constantly being robbed?? no way he should be in last place lol
9,w3grnl_00010,"""That printing guy makes a lot of mistakes"" Hmm he mustve printed the dessert and desert task from season 1? ;)"
10,w3grnl_00011,Omg Josh's march
11,w3grnl_00012,
12,w3grnl_00013,"Holy shit, four countries are gonna declare war on us for this."
13,w3grnl_00014,"I feel like this is the episode where the cast gets into the right energy in studio and it all starts to really gel. The bra moment was great (""we can tell when you're lying"") and I loved the walking in the live task. I can't decide whether Chris was robbed on the scare Jeremy task or not. I thought it was cleverly done, though Paul's medium-paced goat trot in pursuit of the ""kidnap"" car didn't exactly convey urgency. One more highlight: ""I could be the department of the police, or whatever it's called"" ""The police?"" and ""So the police officer and Jeremy's boss and the manager of the cricket team and a...guy in a bush... are all sharing a phone?"" ETA: It's also genuinely adorable that Kura has a poster with the flags of the world in her bathroom."
14,w3grnl_00015,Oh man Greg would've dished out zeroes on that flag task no mercy.
15,w3grnl_00016,"Huh, I actually thought Chris's idea to make Jeremy think he'd died or been in a horrific accident on set was much better than the staged kidnapping. The kidnapping was cute, but having a crew member make that call to Jeremy would've actually been believable (and thus scared the shit out of Jeremy) if executed well - though to make it convincing, he'd have to stop focusing on what STDs he has."
16,w3grnl_00017,"Paul has smiled more this episode than pretty much the rest of the whole show combined, and it makes me very happy. Glad to see he’s having so much fun!"
17,w3grnl_00018,How did Justine get 4 points for not understanding the task?
18,w3grnl_00019,"I've had it, with these mother fucking snakes in this mother fucking mailbox."
19,w3grnl_00020,"'Get closest to the Sun. You have 20 minutes. Fastest wins.' 'Run a full marathon. Fastest wins.' I howled at the Sun task, I can totally see TMNZ doing that next season xDD Didn't think I would ever say this but I loved Jeremy this episode! This was a stellar episode, so many laugh out loud moments for me. I really believed Chris learning to speak story though and his staged kidnapping was also quite good. Loved Paul laughing aswell!"
20,w3grnl_00021,Everyone really messed this flag task up
21,w3grnl_00022,Josh had a breakdown on that phone call. I would of stuck with the IRD plot.
22,w3grnl_00023,Love it how Paul's subconscious is screaming that it was Italy not Mexico with that Lasagne gag!
23,w3grnl_00024,The flag trickery was genius and I’m living for Paul’s interactions with each of the contestants. Are the armrests on Jeremy’s throne meant to look like 💩 or??
24,w3grnl_00025,"As a hobby vexillologist, that flag task has just become one of the funniest tasks in all of taskmaster. Dear God I was crying with laughter."
25,w3grnl_00026,I think the prize task were all pretty good. Would of put Paul's mum 1 pt though
26,w3grnl_00027,"""5:08"""
27,w3grnl_00028,"This season’s really coming into its own this episode. Great tasks, great studio bits, Jeremy really playing into his role. I think anything people have said was missing from the first two episodes has been properly solved for this episode."
28,w3grnl_00029,r/vexillology and r/vexillologycirclejerk are going to have a field day with this episode.
29,w3grnl_00030,"I have some beef with Jeremy’s scoring, especially in regards to Chris. Chris’s scaring task was way underscored for having the best execution, and his prize was given one point to milk the Nazi joke dry. Josh did a funnier joke than all of Jeremy’s stand-up routine on it."
30,w3grnl_00031,Genuinely an all-time classic episode among Taskmaster episodes.
31,w3grnl_00032,"Josh should have won the prize task. By far the most inventive, quite relatable and an actual childhood possession. I mean, your mom is not your possession, however self-centred you were as a child."
32,w3grnl_00033,"While I enjoyed episodes 1 & 2, this one was definitely my favorite of the new series. You had some good call-backs to episode 2, a good variety of tasks for the episode, and the banter was on point. (Though I will say. What is it with trick tasks and having only 1 person get them? First Brynley with desert, now Josh with the flag) You can definitely see the group getting more comfortable with each other with things like Justine's riff on the Chris is a Nazi joke or everyone ganging up on P. Willy about the bra. Also Jeremy has gotten back into stride as well. A quality episode and I look forward to the rest of the series."
33,w3grnl_00034,"I'm actually not a really big fan of John Cena Jeremy Wells's scoring. The picture of Paul Ego's mum would have never gotten 5 points under Greg's watch. And the dismissive way in which he judges certain tasks kind of irks me. For example, I thought Chris's idea of getting kidnapped while discussing his plan to fall off the roof (""get closest to the sun"" sounds like a legit task) was brilliant and deserved way more than a measly two points! Likewise with Josh's ""I'm gonna come and touch your bum!"" voicemails. It's ridiculous that Justine got four points for coming full on at PW with a broadsword. I know every Taskmaster is different, but this season has not been great with its rankings. Speaking of which, it seems like Josh is really running away with this series so far."
34,w3grnl_00035,I'm so happy Chris came up with that hanging solution because it's exactly what I was thinking watching the others. Glad to know it would have worked. Good episode. Josh is my firm favourite both personally and to win the series.
35,w3grnl_00036,
36,w3grnl_00037,"I think my attempt to scare the Taskmaster would be a solemn fake news bulletin where I’d announce that the entire New Zealand cricket team has died in a plane crash except for [whoever the worst player/whipping boy is]. “It’s a tragic day,” said the New Zealand manager, “but we’ll rally and rebuild around Billy Cantbowl.”"
37,w3grnl_00038,"If the contestants had opened up the cans of beans and hung the open cans from the clothesline, would each bean count as a single item? While we debate that, I'm curious how many beans there are in a can. There's no way to know. No way. ...Oh, Josh?"
38,w3grnl_00039,Beautiful hack Chris.
39,w3grnl_00040,"“From where I’m sitting, he could have done it with an iPhone”"
40,w3grnl_00041,"The studio bits this time were great! I love all the inside jokes and throwing each other under the bus, including Paul and Jeremy"
41,w3grnl_00042,This is Richard Osman level task hacking. Brilliant
42,w3grnl_00043,Hahahaha this is such a great meta task performance
43,w3grnl_00044,Kuras foam actually did scare me haha
44,w3grnl_00045,Of course Paul plays into gay stereotypes.
45,w3grnl_00046,Don't play with a dick if you're not in a shid
46,w3grnl_00047,I am loving this Josh and Paul dynamic in the tasks hahaha
47,w3grnl_00048,"The flag task does vex me a bit, mainly because it contradicts my favourite bit from NZS2 with David Correos trusting Paul in the milk task and winning so BIG. And now Paul’s trustworthiness is suspect. Still, I’m gonna come real nice in the dark."
48,w3grnl_00049,Paul involved with 3 episode titles now
49,w3grnl_00050,"Paul Ego made the third title in a row it seems? Unless I have misinterpreted it but if so, someone obviously has favorites. I cant blame them though"
50,w3grnl_00051,So Josh does a Chris R and can't win 3 in a row
51,w3grnl_00052,"I’m enjoying the series, but there’s something about Paul Ego that rubs me the wrong way and I can’t put my finger on it."
52,w3grnl_00053,"Haven't seen any of s3 yet, but the episode title caught my eye - for I have made a Mexican Lasagne (Mexicagne) before - Chilli con carne layered with a Mexicana cheese sauce, pasta sheets, and topped with nachos loaded with jalapenos, guac, salsa, sour cream and more cheese! A masterpiece that would easily start a war if it was presented to either culture!"
53,w3grnl_00054,Wait TM NZ S3 is out??? 🙂🙂🙂
54,w3grnl_00055,I’m just not gelling with this season like I did the other two. No one on it is consistently funny.
55,w3grnl_00056,I want Josh's t-shirt. It was great!
56,w3grnl_00057,"""DAMO!!!"""
57,w3grnl_00058,Is this a post episode discussion or live chat?
58,w3grnl_00059,
0,w9xfy1_00001,"I'm alone and stoned watching the point in episode 5 where the cow is being interrogated over who touched it and there's no episode thread yet but I don't know how to make one and so I have noone to confirm this is real life for me, I'm freaking out."
1,w9xfy1_00002,Ep5 post?
2,w9xfy1_00003,"My two cents for the ""prove you're the smartest"" task: 5x5 - sqrt(25) is equal to both 20 minutes and 30 minutes, since ""-5"" and ""+5"" are both valid solutions to sqrt(25). So simply ask Paul for an extra 10 minutes to the timer. Would have been a very nerdy and not super entertaining approach, but definitely a flex to realise on the spot."
3,w9xfy1_00004,"Late to the party on this one, and want to preface this by saying I like Taskmaster NZ, and also like this group of contestants. However, I thought it was super lame for the bucket task that three of the contestants didn't bother to think it through or apply any creativity whatsoever. The task was ""pull the fewest ropes"" and three of them just shrugged and started pulling ropes without any plan, strategy or creativity in the hopes that they pulled the right rope. One of the three got lucky and found a clue along the way, but her plan was still to just shrug and hope she guessed right. It's taskmaster. There's obviously a trick. I don't expect the contestants to necessarily work out what the trick is, but the fact that they didn't even try was kinda disappointing."
4,w9xfy1_00005,"Great tasks, rubbish contestants. NZ really is on the ball with the creativity on the tasks"
5,w9xfy1_00006,"Having sex with sonny bill in a Pizza Hut is an all time great taskmaster story Anyone not from aus/nz, he’s one of the biggest rugby stars of the past 20 years. Hilarious story."
6,w9xfy1_00007,"""No, I think he uses points"" was a hilarious Lee Mack level of quick by Paul Ego"
7,w9xfy1_00008,"Justine's Disneyland voucher had fine print. Terms and Conditions: All expenses will be covered by the voucher holder--you have to buy your own flights, transfers and accommodation. Jussie may get tired so think of ""Two Days"" pretty loosely. The tour will usually incorporated an afternoon swim and some time drinking cocktails. There is no complaints process, but I will definitely share with you the joys of Disneyland. If Justine becomes annoyed the tour may stop at anytime, so don't be a dick. This is a joke-Please don't take legal action Disney Corporation, I love you and miss you very much. I would prefer to just go with my Husband If I am honest."
8,w9xfy1_00009,"The golf-cart task, despite being debatably fair with 2 people v 3 people, was unapologetically hilarious. I was laughing like a madman when Chris & Paul crashed into the caravan- absolutely legendary."
9,w9xfy1_00010,Josh coming up with that solution to the bucket task but then still forgetting which bucket it was in is absolutely my whole vibe.
10,w9xfy1_00011,"I am becoming such a fan girl for Josh. He’s loud and chaotic, but also smart and methodical and I love not knowing which approach he’ll take each episode. Plus, he looks like he’s having the time of his life in the studio. Now let’s TALK about Classical columns!"
11,w9xfy1_00012,"I loved Chris screaming ""A LEMON"" in the exact cadence of Phil Wang's Lime cry."
12,w9xfy1_00013,To give some NZ context; Sonny Bill Williams is an ex-rugby union and league player and sometimes boxer who was a genuine sports superstar in New Zealand. Probably one of the most recognizable faces in sport over the last 20 years.
13,w9xfy1_00014,"""Cum stains, cum stains, cum stains!"" So first off, skin flute is 100% a penis. I love that Chris won the ""smart"" task by outsmarting the task itself. The juxtaposition of the first team nailing the cart task and then Ego and Chris completely failing on all counts was hilarious. Kura grabbing the QR code and getting the duck right away was so satisfying. I love when those little tricks are implemented! ""Averts his gays"" Justine, complete in her Minnie Mouse ears and dress, dropping the two toilet brushes between her legs led to a squeal of laughter. This had some of the most fun looking tasks to perform, like driving around in a buggy and pulling down buckets."
14,w9xfy1_00015,For anyone who hasn’t seen Sonny Bill Williams. I’ve got to give it up to Kura. Hotchy-Motchy!
15,w9xfy1_00016,I've just realised that Paul Ego is Matt Heath
16,w9xfy1_00017,"Paul: ""No singing this episode!"" Also Paul: ""Wouldn't it be nice if we were older~"""
17,w9xfy1_00018,"Man this series just gets better and better. Solid prize task, and I like how Jeremy got fixated on Herbs & Spices. Hilarious banter about Kura's story in Pizza Hut. And Justine again proving how Disney obsessed she is. Chris really proving he's smarter than the others by relaxing instead of making a fool of himself. Also loved the detail that your and you're were in the wrong places, TM NZ is so good at clever things like that. Some absolutely brilliant editing in this task too: Chris struggling with opening the task, Kura pretending she didn't know she was getting filmed (and it showing 6 camera povs) Very tricky team task, I thought it might've been harder for the team of two, but then again that's one less person to swap shoes with. I always like tasks that have multiple tasks to them. Does seem you could have a team member outside the cart from the beginning though. A good old duck task, classic taskmaster. Love how simple the solution was with it being A-Z. I also thought it was obvious to use the big rope on the pedestal to tie it to all the other ropes. Since you're only holding one rope that should only count as one pull. (whereas Paul Ego held two = pulled two). And a classic Taskmaster guessing live task. I really liked when Paul brought out the second toilet brush they had to hide. So yeah, probably the episode that's had me laughing the most this season. Still waiting in anticipation for the task where Chris is pretending to be Paul Williams."
18,w9xfy1_00019,"I'll be honest, I'd love to go on a lovely weekend holiday with Chris."
19,w9xfy1_00020,"My incomplete list of what was in the buckets. Please feel free to help fill in the blanks. A - Anchovy! - I think whatever was in there was stuck? Here's a look inside the bucket. Slowed it down and there's literally only ONE frame with whatever was in this bucket. Any thoughts? B - Balloon C - Confetti D - Duck E - Egg F - Flour G - Glitter H - H20 I - Ice cubes J - Jigsaw puzzle K - Keys! - No clue what this is, but these are the 2 best shots I could manage of whatever is falling out. 1, 2. It might be a toy Kangaroo? L - Lemon M - Mandarin N - Nothing O - Orange P - Paper! - My guess is a smartPHONE Q - QR Code R - Rice S - Streamers T - Toilet Paper Roll U - Umbrella, Miniature V - VHS Cassette W - Water X - Xylophone, Paul's Y - Yo-yo, Paul's Z - Zucchini Thank you to u/Taskmastermaster for helping to fill out the last nine items!"
20,w9xfy1_00021,"Best one of the series so far, every series of the kiwi version takes a few episodes to hit their stride, but when they do it is amazing."
21,w9xfy1_00022,This episode gave us the NZ version of TM citrus based frustration during guessing tasks TM UK: A LIIIIIIMEEeeee TM NZ: ...a LEmOooaN?
22,w9xfy1_00023,Finally. Strongest ep of the season but weakest title. There were a few better option. Best prize task of the season. Not sure how Kuras was a prize. Think she just wanted to tell the story where only would have gotten more impressive for her over time as SBW got more famous. Team task was fun I liked the trick to the duck task which is really obvious once pointed out. Smartest task I think was some missed opportunities. Chris benefiting from Jeremy's unique scoring criteria where Greg would have given 0 or 1. Jeremy is so good at those live tasks.
23,w9xfy1_00024,"I actually agreed pretty heavily with Jeremy's scoring in this one, which is rare. For the duck task, my instinct was definitely to notice that it was least rope pulls rather than fastest so I probably would've done something like Chris where he took 36 minutes to finally come up with a good solution. Definitely feel for Josh on the smarts task, that's one where the time pressure and open-endedness could easily cause you to freeze and not come up with anything impressive even if you're quite knowledgeable."
24,w9xfy1_00025,Top notch tasks from NZ as always.
25,w9xfy1_00026,My immediate thought on the buckets was to pull the forth one because duck has 4 letters. I was hoping to see someone else try that and win with the wrong logic.
26,w9xfy1_00027,"Man, I had quite a shity day, but this episode made me so happy. I think this episode the series really reached a great level. This is such a chaotic cast, I love them. I've never seen Paul break character this much during the studio bits"
27,w9xfy1_00028,"""No, you dumb fucko, just keep pulling the ropes"" made me laugh Good ep"
28,w9xfy1_00029,Did we see what was in the B bucket? Was it a Brussels Sprout?
29,w9xfy1_00030,I think the smart task needed a bit more structure. Might as well have just said do something. Otherwise solid episode
30,w9xfy1_00031,
31,w9xfy1_00032,Best episode this series by far. I'm mid covid and this made me laugh so bad it hurt.
32,w9xfy1_00033,I loved the little golf cart task
33,w9xfy1_00034,"Something I wondered during the rope pull bucket task, would it be plausible to get another rope and tie it around the others then give it a big pull?"
34,w9xfy1_00035,Goddam Kura! 2004 Rugby league Canterbury You really didn't have to go much further. Astonshing. So conflicted. Like WTF Kura?
35,w9xfy1_00036,Anyone know where to get Paul Ego's shirt from this episode?
36,w9xfy1_00037,
37,w9xfy1_00038,
0,wfakbu_00001,Furtherest? Looks like Brynley wrote that task.
1,wfakbu_00002,"I liked the live task but by giving Paul who went last the 1 bucket, he had to swap and could basically guarantee who got last place! He shpuld have at least had bucket 2 so there was a chance he could choose fewer ducks."
2,wfakbu_00003,"In the live task, were they not allowed to look at the numbers on the cans?"
3,wfakbu_00004,No lab tasks so far!
4,wfakbu_00005,
5,wfakbu_00006,"I really like Jeremy this season. He’s finally opened up and has some bants with all of the contestants, not just his friend, and with Paul as well. I actually like that he’s not Greg, although it’s hilarious how he’s starting to incorporate humiliating Paul into his routine similarly to Greg and Alex"
6,wfakbu_00007,I think Chris’ first gay man on the moon is the most creative thing I’ve seen from any NZ contestant. Has a gay man gone to the moon? We usually go to Uranus
7,wfakbu_00008,The high speed train wreck of Chris touching the cow was chefs kiss
8,wfakbu_00009,"I think Jeremy's getting better in his role! (""it doesn't work like that, you're not allowed to get a girlfriend"")"
9,wfakbu_00010,"In the studio, this live task went for a while, and was far and away the most tense I'd seen people in aaaaaages. The suspense was absurdly high, and you could cut the air with a knife. It was so good. Didn't survive the edit too well. Unlike Carrot in a box, the audience could see the number of ducks on the buckets, and had to hold their breath & not laugh as that would give things away... It contributed massively to the tension. Also, SO many kiwi-isms in this one! Kura as Dame Whina Cooper, the PM being the PM and texting Kura back in her distinctive tone/language, the mention of the water from the lake running to Piha beach (a famous beach on the same side of Auckland as the TM house), Justine's attempt to reference NZ being the 1st country in the world with women's suffrage but then completely going off the tracks in typically Justine manner, Jeremy causally throwing in the te reo maori phrase of ""putting in the mahi"" (work)... There were probably more that I took for granted and missed."
10,wfakbu_00011,Did anyone else immediately start worrying someone would move the bowl
11,wfakbu_00012,"Paul Williams' underrated quip: ""That's why I like running in the rain, so that nobody knows that I'm crying."" Amazing that the final placements of the ducks wound up in order. 1-2-3-4-5. I assume that the contestants were told not to look at the front of the duck buckets where the numbers were. Was there a rule against swapping ducks back from the person who just swapped with you? Otherwise Josh could've got his ducks back from Chris."
12,wfakbu_00013,"""You're forcing me to joust women"" is one of those great out of context taskmaster quotes Edit: ""lactating at the gob"" also got me good Feels like Josh is being underscored here"
13,wfakbu_00014,"FYI, Sam Smith, a writer on the show, tweeted that the Touch The Cow task was written and recorded before TMUK s13 went to air. Just a case of two different creative teams on opposite sides of the world independently coming up with almost identical tasks!"
14,wfakbu_00015,the touch the cow task and the live task I feel are more successful versions of tasks we have seen in TM UK Now we know Chris Parker == Judi Love
15,wfakbu_00016,"I jotted down a bunch of random quotes this episode. Paul Ego: ""Water is a lot wetter than they lead you to believe, you know, when you read about it in the magazines."" Kura: ""I'm trying not to get mad, because this is a peaceful protest, but I'm really fucked off at you."" Josh: ""Whoo! Yeah, that's what's up! Don't mess with the bovine posse, lady!"" Justine: ""We're going to make a stand. Let our nungies nung free."" Regarding the throwing water task, I was kind of sad that creativity wasn't rewarded here. Like Chris throwing the water in the lake or Paul Ego throwing the water on himself. Rather than rewarding those who think outside the box, they kind of just went with the default best throws. Jeremy Wells is sometimes too by the book in this way. It was nice to see Josh still living up to his credo of violence against mannequin women (""It might not be a woman -- it could be a guy with tits."" Paul Ego: ""I'm right here, mate.""). Not sure how that cow massacre warranted only one point though. The touch the cow task was another variation of ""high-five Alex"" from series 13 (originated on Bäst i Test). Absolutely lost it at Josh destroying the chair, plinth and fence while waiting. (""The universe is saying that I'm overweight, I'm clumsy and I'm stupid."") Kura finally got a couple of 5 point tasks! Glad to see she won the episode."
16,wfakbu_00017,Ah the Josh shits the bed episode and let's the others catch up. Man NZ is small when you can message the prime minister as a semi famous comedian and get a reply (tho I suspect probably someone in her team runs her social) Alot of Jeremy's innuendo came out in the edit tonight. Cow task is very similar to the high 5 Alex task but would have filmed before that aired. Live task was basically 5 player carrot in a box
17,wfakbu_00018,"Initially, I thought the cow-touching task would be a bit of a duffer, because it relied on guesswork more than skill. But it turned out to be the funniest part of the episode for me: Josh stumbling about like a drunk horse; Justine’s patience wearing out in less than four minutes; and Chris fucking it before he’d read the whole task. Hilarious."
18,wfakbu_00019,I liked how the make history task made everyone except Chris completely lose their fucking minds. Chris had a solid idea and went with it but the other attempts were just so deranged. Four points for Paul was… generous but he earned it with the Tom Cruise run.
19,wfakbu_00020,"The thing I love about the cow task is the editing bait-and-switch. With how Taskmaster has edited those moments in the past, you hear Josh's comment about someone touching the cow early and immediately think 'oh, so Paul will touch early'. And so he does. But then! It turns out they pulled a sneaky. Turns out, Josh's comment really applied to Chris. You just didn't know it yet."
20,wfakbu_00021,Can we get these posted please before the ep. Its alot easier to make comments about what was happening and kiwisms is way easier when watching it :/
21,wfakbu_00022,Each season Im always excited for a contestant I already know and every season I end up loving someone I don't know for me this season is Kura I love her more with each episode
22,wfakbu_00023,"I love how Chris involves Paul in his tasks like the kidnapping, the massage and the moon landing"
23,wfakbu_00024,I like the cow premise more than the high five one for UK taskmaster but the editing was a lot better in the UK one where we can see how they did it in real time all together rather than being told.
24,wfakbu_00025,"How on earth was ""lactating at the gob"" not the episode title? The titles have been super weak this series for some reason."
25,wfakbu_00026,Justice for Chris's water throw
26,wfakbu_00027,"I think this was the first episode that wasn't 10/10 for me. Not that it wasn't bad, but 7/10 solid. Congrats to Paul though for committing to the ice cream bit. Holy moly. Felt like I needed to wash my hands after that."
27,wfakbu_00028,"Josh deserved better on the prize task. That's it, that's all I had to say."
28,wfakbu_00029,I was at the live task and Josh's explanation of hitting woman and disable people was as awkward as it was on TV. I was surprised the keeper it in. Thought they would edit around it.
29,wfakbu_00030,"Me trying to talk to my nonTM fan husband about the Make History task: I'd have opened the task, read it and then declined to participate and walked away. In the studio I'd point out that no contestant in TM history has ever refused to do a task. He thinks I'd get no points or disqualified. Am I right though? I've seen all of them except USA and I can't recall anyone refusing to do a task..... (NonTM fan husband did join me in the studio audience for S3.E3 and enjoyed himself, so I can't work out why he won't watch with me!)"
30,wfakbu_00031,"I (non kiwi) think I just figured out what Jeremy says at the top of each episode, is it ""Tēnā koe?”"
31,wfakbu_00032,"I was confident Paul would go for an early touch but wasn't expecting it from Chris. Not surprised Josh went the longest but I'm a little surprised nobody went over 30 minutes, but I guess it does get pretty boring if you just sit next to the cow. I really liked the water throwing task, and I agree with Jeremy giving Paul a 0m distance, but I think he should've gotten 1 point for his 0 meters. I don't think the live task could've gone a second round, because then the contestants would have too much knowledge of the containers, but the ending felt a bit abrupt to me. It's probably just because of the amount of footage they had to cut that was just the contestants looking into the buckets, which was definitely a good cut."
32,wfakbu_00033,Justine’s puppet is the most horrific prize I’ve seen on any iteration of this show. And that includes the time James Acaster brought in a mummified cat!
33,wfakbu_00034,"Jeremy appears to start and end the episodes with what I assume to be Maori phrases, can someone tell me what those phrases are he's saying? (Sorry if it isn't Maori don't want to be ignorant, want to learn)"
34,wfakbu_00035,"I love how something simple like ""throw water the farthest"" ends up being gold."
35,wfakbu_00036,"With the prize task my first thought was ""surely an NFT"""
36,wfakbu_00037,"Paul trying to work out who would be the other 4 people to touch the cow is similar to Ardal's, If I hi-5 multiple times I might get 3rd. Then it would be up to Jeremy to decide how to score his 4th person attempt, and naturally how Chris being super fast affects his position in touching the cow. If Paul (TMA) hadn't have said anything it could have been interesting discussion in studio."
37,wfakbu_00038,"Another banger of an episode! Would love to see the full set of photos that were on the desk at the start of the ""make history"" task."
38,wfakbu_00039,The live task felt like watching the carrot in a box live task from Taskmaster Norway
0,wkkmvx_00001,"Pre-empting to say that based on the episode title, there will be a joke about Raro in this episode"
1,wkkmvx_00002,Thanks for posting this up well before the episode goes live! You da real r/taskmaster's assistant!
2,wkkmvx_00003,I really enjoyed the final task and the hide and seek task The luck task was fun in theory but ended up too easy for most of them. Josh's meltdown was funny though. I didn't realize we never got a TMNZ tie breaker
3,wkkmvx_00004,"Jeremy being more critical of Paul this season. Hahaah coconut edition of the cookbook everyone in NZ has. My first thought was a boat too, but more luxury yacht. Well that Meltdown is the Josh we know. Morale of the story there is always a trick. Knew there had to be a shortcut. Haven't seen the Lab much this season. Oh Paul that green suit. Milkman looks like kermit. Oh Jeremy creating extra points. And then them all turning out equal.. Nz utilising the face cam. Oh this one is like the s8 task in the train yard. ""That's a sexy tree"" hahah that's the one from s1. Chris at an advantage wearing green. That's the smartest thing Paul has done too bad his time wasn't better. Fuck this live task is confusing. Taken 3 seasons to get a tiebreaker!!"
4,wkkmvx_00005,"okay my thoughts roughly in order as I noted them down. Yes in the intro we saw Jeremy telling Paul off, but in keeping with his TM persona - this telling off would be way too gentle for Greg but struck the right tone for how Jeremy has always be quite nice to Paul so it would be weird for him to berate like Greg would have done to Alex. Doubled headed coin very nice! good work NZ. I feel depending on the series UK would have had at least 1 superstitious person. Knowing how you can't write this stuff sometimes I feel like if someone had done the longer versions we would see someone run in to put the ladder away and run out without spotting the coin though. Intolerance man may need a name change, sounds like he will teach us to be intolerant of others not something to do with allergies. The scoring on that one was a bit of a cop out. patting Paul on the back, on reading it had series 8 vibes of being at the railway station and sneaking up on Alex, some nice twists on that to make it a new and different task. Paul working out the loophole very impressive, although working it out incredibly late so it didn't help him much. I lost track at the final task myself. Nice little tie breaker, simple but gets the job done - love the repeated use of Pauls measuring run. I see that is becoming a running gag."
0,wkrlgb_00001,We're going through the UK version now for the first time. Came to the sub and saw this about a NZ version. How do the kiwis go?
1,wkrlgb_00002,"I thought that the hide and seek train task from Series 8 was brilliant, but the hide and seek task from this episode took that idea to a whole new level!"
2,wkrlgb_00003,"This was a really nice episode. It's a bit disappointing how rarely this cast secon guesses the tasks, though, considering how well thought-out the tasks are. Nonetheless: The bit with Paul dragging the cat across Kura's path is perfect for out of context compilations: short, cute, nonsensical. The sexy tree callback :') Dr Dicksaver giving the same vibes as that coach from Napoleon Dynamite. A fun studio task! And the little interaction between Chris and Paul: ""Put that back."""
3,wkrlgb_00004,The ads showing for the next episode show what looks like a pretty hilarious bit I think everyone here will enjoy.
4,wkrlgb_00005,josh with the coin is this season’s david with the grape
5,wkrlgb_00006,Favorite episode of the season. That superhero tasks highlights something important you need in contestants cause some people would just not be able to pull that off. It was weird AF in the best possible way.
6,wkrlgb_00007,Chris' Batman voice was perfection
7,wkrlgb_00008,"One thing I noticed about Justine is that when she receives a bad score or comment from the Taskmaster she seems genuinely unhappy in a way that’s sincere and will linger. In this episode it was when she received one point for the first part of the superhero task scoring, which was of course immediately negated by the second half of the scoring. It’s how many felt bad for Hugh Dennis for the dance task scoring in series 4. Nothing Justine can do about it, but it’s a bit harder to enjoy as opposed to David Correos or Josh thrashing about."
8,wkrlgb_00009,"I'm amazed that Justine is now in second place in the series, Josh has 96, Justine has 90, Kura and Paul both have 89 and Chris has 86. It is much closer than I thought, but think Josh is still going to run away with it :)"
9,wkrlgb_00010,Oh God Phil Wang's gigantic kiwi cousins have arrived
10,wkrlgb_00011,"Josh's rage at not getting 5 heads and kicking the table was the biggest laugh for me. I love how his running theme is destroying all the props. He had real Jack Black energy this episode, especially during the superhero task. The irony of Intolerance Man wearing blackface. The ""tap Paul on the back"" task was so fun, vaguely reminiscent of the TM UK task where they're hiding from Alex. I loved that Kura got in the car and Ego stole the starting mat. Bummer that Justine got so close to winning the episode, but the ""pop a cork"" task felt very anticlimactic. Some fun quotes I jotted down this episode: Paul: ""Are you worried about the bad luck?"" Chris: ""Nah. Superstition's for cucks."" Josh: ""If you give me five tails, I'm going to put this in my bum."" (*whew* ""It's a big coin."") Justine: ""I can see what you're doing, Paul, and I simply cannot be bothered engaging."""
11,wkrlgb_00012,"""What do you have to say to lady luck"" ""Fuck ya bitch"" Kura really had me smiling this episode"
12,wkrlgb_00013,"Obsessed at Jeremy's inability to keep a straight face while saying ""So Intolerance Man lives...in a pile of leaves..."" He so rarely breaks! I like that this cast is so evenly matched. Everyone has had really strong tasks and some weak ones. Overall I get why some people find this season disappointing compared to Season 2--this group is more of an acquired taste--but I am really loving it just as much."
13,wkrlgb_00014,"Great desert/dessert callback, also Paul calling that tree ""sexy"""
14,wkrlgb_00015,That seemed strangely reminiscent of the hide and seek railyard task from UK. Nice use of a hack from Ego.
15,wkrlgb_00016,Paul properly Osman-ed that one.
16,wkrlgb_00017,great look from Josh ‘it’s not blackface’ Thompson
17,wkrlgb_00018,"The coin flip thing really has me wishing just 1 person decided to take the hard route and find the coin. TM is so great with moments like that where 1 contestant finds the easter egg, and you get to watch the other 4 react. Paul's mat trick on the stalking task was great though, and it kind of scratched that itch."
18,wkrlgb_00019,"Loved everything about this episode, especially the stage task. That was brilliant. Started simple enough and you could see that everyone was feeling pretty good about themselves and then it gradually got harder and they each started falling apart. I also loved that Jeremy deliberately made everyone get equal points in the superhero task so it made no difference at all to the outcome for the episode or the series."
19,wkrlgb_00020,145 flips. Josh was justified in breaking the table.
20,wkrlgb_00021,"Loved the editing in the luck task at 13:24 when the music speeds up as if Josh is gonna finish the task, but then nope. IT syked me."
21,wkrlgb_00022,"I knew he was in the leaves. I knew there was going to be a brief beat to elicit suspense. I knew the leaf pile was going to explode as soon as he went into action. I knew all this, yet I still laughed like a damned hyena when he appeared. Jeremy’s inability to keep a straight face when he asked Josh why Intolerance Man didn’t just live in his car rather than a pile of leaves: >chef’s kiss<."
22,wkrlgb_00023,Paul's piss definitely has a strong raro flavour
23,wkrlgb_00024,"""I'm just a chilled out guy..."" God Josh having this much bad luck is perfectly within character"
24,wkrlgb_00025,"Point totals:     Still pretty close, and technically winnable by anyone!"
25,wkrlgb_00026,Is this the first use of the word ‘cuck’ in any Taskmaster?
26,wkrlgb_00027,Nice to see Jeremy having a good giggle
27,wkrlgb_00028,"Great tasks, even the superhero one which I thought would be rubbish was good. Love the repeat of the Alex at the train station task, that went really well especially with Paul's workaround"
28,wkrlgb_00029,"First NZ tiebreaker ever! Sad for Justine that she hasn't managed to bring one home yet but I think she can do it, nobody has really been a runaway loser this season. Loved the camera task, as many people have said it's much like the Alex at the trainyard task which is a classic. Glad Paul found the strategy even if it was too late. The fortune trail task was fun, although I felt bad for Josh that we heard Paul instruct him ""no cheating"" on the flips when it seemed that most other ""cheated."" Superhero task was strange but in a fun way, overall a good episode."
29,wkrlgb_00030,"Jeremy being more critical of Paul this season. Hahaah coconut edition of the cookbook everyone in NZ has. My first thought was a boat too, but more luxury yacht. Well that Meltdown is the Josh we know. Morale of the story there is always a trick. Knew there had to be a shortcut. Haven't seen the Lab much this season. Oh Paul that green suit.

30,wkrlgb_00031,"""Superstitions for cucks"""
31,wkrlgb_00032,"Superhero task was the hardest I've laughed all season. Had a feeling there was a double sided coin somewhere, though I guess hiding it in the coin jar would've been too obvious."
32,wkrlgb_00033,It's the Joe Thomas memorial special task!
33,wkrlgb_00034,The zoom in on his face when he got it hahahah
34,wkrlgb_00035,This might be my favourite episode so far. Great fun!
35,wkrlgb_00036,"I know it's basically impossible for Taskmaster NZ to be influenced by Suurmestari but I think it's amazing that the most recent episode of Suurmestari had the exact same prize task. Not only the same task, but Riku brought in the same prize as Kura. I wonder how many people Castaway has forever linked desert islands and Wilson."
36,wkrlgb_00037,I cannot wait to see what Josh has done here
37,wkrlgb_00038,During the luck task I knew there would be a double headed coin in there! Surprised to one thought it.
38,wkrlgb_00039,"For the prize task, the obvious answer is: satellite phone. Even if you have a boat, you might be lost in endless ocean. Satellite phone means a well-stocked rescue boat."

1,wqj2ez_00002,"I love Paul and Chris’ team dynamic so much! It seems like they both individually go back and forth a little on how reserved to be or what vibe to present, but together they instinctively see each other’s batshit side clearly and just openly encourage each other to lean in."
2,wqj2ez_00003,"If anyone has a gif of Justine's face immediately after Josh says ""ocean"" in the live task, please send it my way 😂"
3,wqj2ez_00004,I could've watched 45 minutes of the debate task. That was so funny.
4,wqj2ez_00005,"It's kinda fascinating how good Kura was at noticing changes around the room, except for David. Especially considering that he managed to change a room quite a lot on his own in S2. Josh and Chris jumping in synch to clarinet's defence makes me think that clarinetists have to deal with it a lot."
5,wqj2ez_00006,Give Paul money was probably a tiebreaker task originally
6,wqj2ez_00007,"I was confident that there was a stash of money hidden somewhere in the caravan. I know they sometimes hold onto a ""secret hack"" if no one discovers it, but if there was one here, they desperately needed something to spice this one up."
7,wqj2ez_00008,"""The tragic return of David Correos"""
8,wqj2ez_00009,"Both Enchanted Forests were batshit in the best way, but Paul Ego's performance as the Cow Slayer won the day for me. ""Gladly, my BITCH-QUEEN"" ""Oooh- good kneeling"" ""Yes, yeeeeesss.. he is soak-ed!"" Just everything he did got me."
9,wqj2ez_00010,“Did you win your season” “No that’s why I’m here” so good!!
10,wqj2ez_00011,"Holy shit, NZ Taskmaster writers are bloody creative. That President task!"
11,wqj2ez_00012,That linking blockbuster task is hands-down one of the best ideas from any Taskmaster series. That’s worthy of bringing over to the UK.
12,wqj2ez_00013,David Correos cameoing as wallpaper has to be one of my favorite moments in all TMNZ
13,wqj2ez_00014,"Great tasks this episode, with the exception of ""Give Paul money"" -- what a scam! I'm still waiting for the twist/second part of that task to be revealed, because it was disappointingly straightforward, as was Paul Ego's miserly attitude. ""I'm sorry, Paul, I'm not giving you any money. I mean, look at the way you're dressed. Clearly, you either own a stables or you're a slave owner from the 1800s."" ""I don't own a stables."" Both the ""spot 12 differences"" (Chris calculating 11 minutes: ""It'll be 11 sixties"") and blockbuster trailer tasks were some of my favorites of the series. It was hilarious to see David Correos playing a part of the wallpaper, while Kura and Ego struggled to spot him. And the way the film trailer linked was so satisfying, as was the egg nailing Ego right in the nuggets. I love how their American accent involved saying ""Goddamnit"" a lot. I appreciated the Jumanji reference. ""Did you see Jack Black?"" ""No, I was in the Robin Williams."" I was going to complain about the Olympic bronze medalist winning the prize task, but I was glad to see her actually there at the very end. Also, such a dumb Josh thing that made me laugh: ""Your time starts... meow."""
14,wqj2ez_00015,I think the affirmative won the live task.
15,wqj2ez_00016,"Chris Parker isn't the typical comedy style I like, but I love how he seems to know exactly how to get Paul Williams to laugh. (And the enchanted forest was admittedly hilarious.)"
16,wqj2ez_00017,"Paul: ""No special effects were used in the delivery of this task"" Justine: ""Oh no..."" Josh: Folds over in shame, head in hands Me: This is going to be a great task"
17,wqj2ez_00018,"Justine: ""Let's stand here and make him do it for a bit longer, cos it's quite tragic"" I love Justine's quips so much One from last week that I also loved: ""*sigh* I can see what you're doing, Paul, and I simply cannot be bothered engaging"""
18,wqj2ez_00019,
19,wqj2ez_00020,"That opening money task had the feel of a tie breaker, I'm thinking perhaps it was but after everyone said Paul would give the most having him do what he did made it funny enough to justify it being a proper task. Lucky p-willy"
20,wqj2ez_00021,"Prize task good use of the word ""stick"" there from Justine. The money task seemed odd - either Jeremy should have done the ""what task is that? I never set that? give me the money"" to Paul in the studio especially given the poor stationery etc. OR it should have had normal stationery and had a follow up with something like ""Buy the taskmaster the best gift, your budget is <enter value they donated or enclose the giftcard/coin rubbings back depending on the contestant>"" Did love seeing David back for a cameo, much like Angela came back for a task in series 2. I hope they bring back a fan fave each year as a 1 off. Series scores are very close for 2-5, but number 1 has a small but noticeable lead."
21,wqj2ez_00022,Loved the evil queen sex bitch
22,wqj2ez_00023,"I'm also puzzled by the money task. Especially since the ""find the difference"" task ended with that discussion with Kura about whether Paul is getting paid. So they could have swapped the order and pretended that that was Paul taking things into his own hands. Oh well. Everything else about the episode was great."
23,wqj2ez_00024,"""We're both woodwinders"" killed me."
24,wqj2ez_00025,"How did the money not come back?! Also, the live task and the trailer task are some of the best task ideas in the entire Taskmaster universe."
25,wqj2ez_00026,"There's got to be more to the money task coming in a later episode, and I'm excited to see what Paul's $3.50 in change etched on paper does to impact it if it does happen. Like, maybe the other contestants will all have a reasonable budget for something while Paul has to find a way to do it with drawings of coins."
26,wqj2ez_00027,Given his track record with women thus far I'm surprised no one had an issue with Josh bringing a woman in as his 'best thing'
27,wqj2ez_00028,The abacus pan flute was an inspired touch
28,wqj2ez_00029,Don't know if I've ever seen wallpaper giggle so hard
29,wqj2ez_00030,"Best episode of the series so far? I agree that I was expecting something more from the Give Paul the Most Money task, was a little odd that there was no follow-up. I'm also curious what would've happened if someone tried a larger sum of fake money, like if Paul had gone for $1000 or something. The others were top tier tasks , the enchanted forest one had me in stitches"
30,wqj2ez_00031,First task proper reminding me of Ol' Moneybags Al Murray
31,wqj2ez_00032,Love seeing David back on our Taskmaster screens!
32,wqj2ez_00033,Hahaha that opening by Jeremy. ACCURATE Strong Prizes!!! Money task was screaming for a 2nd part. Was kinda weird tbh. Team task was bizarre. Every season now someone has made Paul dance. That spot the difference task was genius. Oh they are all going to link Return of the tom cruise run... Pretty hard to score the movie. Bit weird he chose accents when I dont remember it being a requirement? But guess you have to base it on something. Those school desks are a blast from the past. Josh get a bit of a lead again.
33,wqj2ez_00034,The wallpaper stripes on David’s body paint looking like suspenders: perfection
34,wqj2ez_00035,"Wow, this episode is a banger! So many creative tasks, and it's hard to remember an episode with so many laugh out loud moments."
35,wqj2ez_00036,The film trailer task is one of the best task in the history of taskmaster. So good.
36,wqj2ez_00037,I was there live on this night - just as good as I remember. I'm laughing harder at home than I did in the audience
37,wqj2ez_00038,"I thought this was a very mixed bag of an episode. 11 minutes/12 differences was excellent, although I think David's cameo stole the show from what would've been a fun task on its own. I enjoyed the blockbuster task, although I was surprised by Jeremy saying everyone did well but still giving out points 1-2-3-4-5 (not that I have a problem with that, it just seems unlike him). The prize task was pretty good too. EDIT: Forgot to mention the enchanted forest task. Not my absolute favorite, but it was unhinged in a good way, so definitely still enjoyable. However, the other two tasks were misses, IMO. Give Paul the most money I thought would have some sort of wrinkle, but it really just was everybody sitting in the caravan thinking about their budgets besides Paul Ego shitting on P-Willy but not really even trying to win the task. The live task I wasn't a fan of, it reminded me of the UK S11 argument task in that everyone had to focus so much on getting the last word right that the rest of their lines were not that interesting or sensible for the most part. I'm not unhappy with the episode, as there were still some strong moments, but I think we've definitely seen much better, even in this season."
38,wqj2ez_00039,
39,wqj2ez_00040,"Isn't the give Paul money task a reference to the first ever ""task"" Alex gave which was give him money? Probably my fav ep of the series. What a fantastic ep!"
40,wqj2ez_00041,"David looked like the brother of the girl from ""The Ring"""
41,wqj2ez_00042,"I too thought that there would be some sort of button to the money task. Like in the Belgium version of Taskmaster they gave someone a solo task where they had to transfer money to the Taskmaster’s bank account. This of course got him no points. At the studio the Taskmaster ate caviar the amount of which was the amount that could be purchased by the amount transferred to him. So I was thinking that maybe in the studio Paul could be wearing some ridiculous accessory that was worth the amount paid to him. Or else Paul could give them gifts the amount that was given to him. Who knows. It was a fun concept. I was also thinking that if they could locate a copy of Monopoly they could find that ""money""."
42,wqj2ez_00043,
43,wqj2ez_00044,"“Paul’s hint and the pre visuals for task one makes it look like it’s “Give Paul money, time starts now”, but that would be stupid” Give Paul money, time starts now Oh"
44,wqj2ez_00045,"Josh, Justine and Kura’s enchanted forest video gave me a creepy Judderman flashback."
45,wqj2ez_00046,
0,wwdgpa_00001,Everyone’s reaction of complete shock and horror to it taking Justine 87(!) attempts at the William Tell task was amazing and adorable. They looked genuinely sad for her and amazed she did it for so long.
1,wwdgpa_00002,When Paul completely breaks and laughs out loud at Josh's doppelganger 💖
2,wwdgpa_00003,"While I don’t think Jeremy lurks here, I do think he’s the type of person that if he got wind of people complaining about his scoring he’d give out even more even scores and then deny all of knowledge of it. I like Josh’s doppelgänger, he’d be fun on a later season I think."
0,x28a99_00001,"Only just getting around to this season but absolutely loving all the through lines and running jokes that UK hasn't seem to have done much of as far as I remember! Chris' arc this episode was easily one of the best moments across all versions of this show imo. Really wasn't loving this season at first especially after season 2, but man has it improved in such an amazing way in the second half! Really warmed to all the cast but Chris, Josh and especially Kura are big standouts for me this time around. From what I've seen it looks like the recently announced Australian adaptation will be made and written by much of the same team as NZ so fingers crossed the kind of consistently clever tasks, editing, etc. that NZ has excelled at will be found there too 🤞 Edit: Jesus, been watching multiple in a row so I totally forgot this episode had the cereal one too. What a great episode! P. Willy seems to be having a ton of fun too so even just that alone is worth watching the season for."
1,x28a99_00002,Does anyone know where Josh's shirt this episode was from? Loved the graphic
2,x28a99_00003,"Genuinely don't think anyone on TM around the world has forced me to do a 180 as much as Chris has. I really couldn't be dealing with him early on, but the second half of the season he's been so good and the body in the box was the cherry on that cake. He's nailed it again and again, really good contestant. Josh and Kura both saying ""all the information you need is on the task,"" and the way it was cut, was also great. Nature task was dumb but everything else was good stuff."
3,x28a99_00004,"I am probably the only one, but I have found the task so weak for at least a couple episodes. There are too many creative tasks, and not enough head scratchers. It works still, because the cast is hilarious and good at creative tasks, but it lacks variety imo."
4,x28a99_00005,"I actually (embarrassingly) clapped while on my own, when Chris revealed Sacky. So bloody good. Also love how much Jeremy has come into his own this season, he’s bantering more and seems to be having more fun in the role which is great to see."
5,x28a99_00006,How peeved do you think Josh must have been that he didn't find that secret wet task right before he decided to get in a lake?
6,x28a99_00007,I hope this running gag of contestants bringing in Jeremy's relatives for prize task continues in all future seasons too. Edit: also I love how much all 7 of them are enjoying themselves. It was very evident today with all of them shining comedically and getting great response from the rest. I've never seen Paul and Jeremy laugh this hard before.
7,x28a99_00008,Chris seems to be running away with the points here and with that prize task mystery reveal he's also running away with my heart
8,x28a99_00009,"NZ is starting to outclass original flavor TM for task creation. The live task from this week is something I'm definitely going to play with the family over the holidays. The long term storytelling of the Best Friend tasks was so satisfying, not to mention remarkably innovative. I was worried at the start of this season that it would almost certainly be a letdown from season 2 because that cast had been soo so good. But it looks like I wasn't giving enough credit to the TMNZ crew."
9,x28a99_00010,"I feel bad for Justine. I think she really cared about doing well in the tasks (she's a longtime TM fan from what I've read) and she is just being scored so harshly. ...I also suspect that this is what would happen to me, if I ever became a contestant."
10,x28a99_00011,"Before I watched it: Kind of a lame title, but ok whatever After I watched it: WELL ALRIGHT!"
11,x28a99_00012,"I was sort of thinking ""why didn't they specify the body had to be disposed of on the property."" And, oh, I'm so glad they didn't. Utterly brilliant play by Chris."
12,x28a99_00013,Chris' prize task deserved 100 points after that reveal.
13,x28a99_00014,'xcuse your fucking mouth. Iconic.
14,x28a99_00015,The Sacky Saga is one of the best contestant moves I’ve ever seen. I feel like there wasn’t enough emphasis placed on how good putting the toe-tag in Paul’s bedroom was. And the box reveal was just chefs kiss
15,x28a99_00016,Legendary live task! So good.
16,x28a99_00017,"TMUK has done a few two-part tasks over the years, but we just saw a three-parter, and arguably five parts if we count the prize and live tasks even if they weren't originally intended to be included in this saga."
17,x28a99_00018,TMNZ is the best at the long con and I love it.
18,x28a99_00019,"Josh was robbed in the prize task! ""Somewhere in that paddock is a quarter of a million dollars"" how did that not win? Even if you're not interested in Star Wars/memorabilia at all, it's still money."
19,x28a99_00020,Nature task was a weak task but was saved by Josh
20,x28a99_00021,Chris is on fire this back end of the series. Has anyone won 5 eps in a season? He must be winning overall now? Feel bad for Josh
21,x28a99_00022,Chris deserved retroactive bonus points for the prize task
22,x28a99_00023,
23,x28a99_00024,"This ep was so good. Josh, Kura and Justine were genius with that live task. Also Chris Parker was amazing in this episode, that Sacky in the mystery box reveal had my jaw on the floor. So good"
24,x28a99_00025,"The amount of farm-animal-worrying in TMNZ confirms the main stereotype I've been told about Kiwis since I started watching Flight of the Conchords in 2007. I can put Goose-Chris biting Paul in my gallery along with Brynley chasing some sheep yelling ""Come baaaack! I need you for my criiiiime!"""
25,x28a99_00026,The scoring on the cereal task was wack but I feel better about it if Justine didn’t actually create a cereal. One point is brutal though! It took this group a while to warm up but I think overall this is on par with the best TM seasons. I will miss these guys after next week!
26,x28a99_00027,"Wow lots of people in the comments really pressed about Jeremy and the scoring, I actually love him this season goofing off with everyone. It's not a democracy: just like Greg has his whims like underscoring young people, so does Jeremy. The points don't really matter, do they. The payoff with the box though, holy shit."
27,x28a99_00028,"Prize task seemed underwhelming but it was absolutely worth it as the set-up for the Sacky reveal. Nature task wasn't my favorite but had the excellent moment with Josh. Cereal task was fun but Jeremy totally fucked the scoring, I would've certainly had Justine with 5 followed by Josh, Chris, Paul, then Kura last. Hide the dead body was absolutely fantastic. Great performances and great comedy. The wet task was a great concept but using it here meant its execution was overshadowed. I do have a gripe with the scoring, however. It says ""if you complete the task while wet you win,"" but the task ended in the studio, where Chris was no longer wet. Additionally, the ""you win"" part seemed to imply to me that you would instantly win the task you were wet in rather than getting 5 extra points. Admittedly, Chris did do so well in the hide the body task that he probably earned those extra points, but it seemed excessive to give him 10 for hide the body just because he was wet. The live task was awesome, it looked incredibly fun and the team of three's strategy was great. Seems like they should've smashed it but they weren't very accurate with the pillow throws."
28,x28a99_00029,"And there it goes, Paul Ego's advertising voice-over voice. So smooth, so all over our bloody airwaves."
29,x28a99_00030,"God, Chris is a genius. If he takes this out as well as CTI I can see him giving up standup to pursue a life of celebrity competition glory."
30,x28a99_00031,"I’ve flipped to wanting Chris to win this season. British Chris take note; THIS is how you do a mystery box on a prize task. This best friend saga has been wonderful, big ups to the creative team. Was befuddled by the “become one with nature” task. They got lucky that the cast isn’t super competitive or else more of the contestants would’ve “finished” after 1 second. Sketch-writing is far and away when this cast really shines, loved those cereal commercials. Glad to see Jeremy calling himself out on his fence-sitter scoring."
31,x28a99_00032,"You're really seeing Jeremy having a lot more fun with the show now, I really like that!"
32,x28a99_00033,"Highly enjoyable episode and probably the peak of the season. I'm sad we've only got one episode left because the entire cast has seriously grown on me. ""Excuse your fuckin' mouth!"" and ""Well, all right!"" were such great catchphrases. I loved how Justine kept cracking up when they repeated it in the studio. Speaking of which, Juzzie got robbed in that cereal task and her booger rap was completely overlooked. For the hide the body task, the natural thing would have been to chop the body into various pieces and hide it all over the property. (I'm surprised Josh didn't think of that.) I fucking loved the massive misdirections Josh and Kura did to Paul, though. Also, love Paul's dedication to finding the bodies even while off the clock. ""It's...(catches breath)...Gorothia."" For some reason, I thought taking it off the premises wasn't allowed, so I was expecting Chris to get penalized for that (despite invoking the hidden task). But the callback to the ""riddle"" box was just brilliant. Some of these things work out so perfect, it almost feels like it was pre-planned. For example, who would have stood in as the third person in the live task if Chris hadn't brought along Sacky? Human Battleship was fun, but I feel like the pile on at the beginning was just cheating. ""You have sunketh me!"" One question: in the intro, there is a shot of Chris with googly eyes saying ""My name is Paul Williams."" Have we seen that task yet? This whole season, it's been the one thing I've been looking forward to seeing the most."
33,x28a99_00034,Oh wow Jeremy acknowledged his over use of scoring everyone 5 points
34,x28a99_00035,"Them: Don't worry, the Sugar Boogas Paul is not real, he can't hurt you. The starting sequence: My name is Paul Williams 👀. Amazing foreshadowing from Justine there, with googly-eyed Paul we've been looking at for nine weeks. Josh is really good with coming up with catch phrases: in the golf cart task, and now with cereal. I love how everyone's become comfortable in the studio and is honestly having fun. A very comfy watching."
35,x28a99_00036,"I think the NZ casts as a whole really thrive in the open-ended, creative tasks. I don't know if it's NZ's sense of humor, but the chaos that always ensues is brilliant and the contestants so far always seem to be having the time of their lives with them. I would love to see a few more timed/clear-cut tasks in the next season because it's also fun to see how different people tackle something simple (like squirt the sun lotion the furthest). Chris has been my favorite this season since episode 1, and he is on a roll! Has there been a contestant that won this many episodes in any other version? I think it took a bit for the contestants to feel comfortable in the studio, but they seem to have gotten closer and more open. We've had some great studio banter in the last three episodes. I wish we could see unedited footage of the contestants hiding the bodies. It sounds like quite a bit was cut out from what was shown in the studio. Josh mentioned finding Paul in the shed, Paul had to get a cameraman when he found the sack in the forest, and Paul called Chris to ask where Sacky was hidden. I love how dedicated Paul was to find the bodies. He seems to have as much fun on the show and in his role as the contestants do."
36,x28a99_00037,Already not looking forward to any span of time without new TMNZ each week. :(
37,x28a99_00038,"Absolutely amazing cereal task and hide the dead body tasks. Absolutely rubbish ""Become one with nature, fastest wins?"" though, what was that about!"
38,x28a99_00039,"That's a different way to do the secret task, but think that will give Chris the series win"
39,x28a99_00040,Kura makes me laugh more and more each week. Her humour is just so fun.
40,x28a99_00041,"Good call from Jeremy there. No definition on what ""with nature"" was and Josh was the best even if slower."
41,x28a99_00042,Loved this cereal task. Justine deserves more.
42,x28a99_00043,"My cereal task ranking best to worst. 1. Justine, 2.chris, 3. Josh 4. Paul. 5. Kura"
43,x28a99_00044,Strongest episode of this series. Justine's cereal task was criminally underscored though. Jeremy needs to work out that not every task needs a 1 point result I loved the audience messing with the teams in the live task
44,x28a99_00045,"weak first half of the episode with a storming come back. prize task - it was okay, nothing stands out as being really great or poor at the intro to the show. nature - for NZ this was again a fairly weak task, Josh definitely made it his own and very much deserves the 5 points even though he was the slowest - I'd say that it would have been improved with changing from a fastest wins to the most at one with nature wins with a maximum time limit. I'm glad he wasn't given 1 point due to speed. Breakfast - This task didn't ring my bell either, yes it was stronger than previous but I don't know just didn't tickle me. Justine was underscored for sure. How Kura's is financial viable I'm not sure. Hide the dead body - great follow on from last week. I did commend Paul's (TMA) dectective skills with finding Paul Ego's body only to have him find nothing for a looooong time with the other 3. Chris was amazing. I wonder who on production knew about Sacky being in the mystery box as it was a very weird coincidence that it was mystery box week that this happened, although it could have been an earlier prize and Paul would have had to stop the clock at the end of an episode when the winner went to collect their prize and discovered Sacky. Live task - Brilliantly funny, but again needing and extra person and coincidentally having Sacky to hand? Someone on production must have been in the loop. I half hope they do this studio task in the UK version it is soooo good to not be re-used. If not in UK in other countries were it is common place for tasks to be reused they should steal this one as it is great."
45,x28a99_00046,This has been the funniest season of all the taskmasters. I was weeping openly with laughter on more than one occasion (most recently with Ego honey and oats). Contestants shine brightest with creative tasks
46,x28a99_00047,The secret task needs to be done more often. What a great idea!
47,x28a99_00048,Great fish poster in that shid.
48,x28a99_00049,"Oh man, if Josh found that hidden task he would have won it easily doing the nature task."
49,x28a99_00050,There is a new Zealand taskmaster?!? Oh boy something else to binge. I watched the British one so many times lol
50,x28a99_00051,Aren't links typically up by now?
51,x28a99_00052,Not Paul's leaky box 😄
52,x28a99_00053,"The music at the end (in the trailer for next weeks show) is the ""copy alex"" theme! https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&v=h1AdOHtXCG0&feature=emb_title"
53,x28a99_00054,"For the bonus task: I would argue that Chris did not COMPLETE the task while wet. Paul stopped his timer in studio, where he is clearly dry."
54,x28a99_00055,Two points for None Of Your Beeswax? At this point you could replace Jeremy with a random dude rolling a five-sided die for the contestants scores and no one would notice any difference.
55,x28a99_00056,"If the secret task was to be wet for the entirety of a task, then it shouldn't end until the clock stopped."
56,x28a99_00057,I loved how Jeremys intro seemed to set up as 'the greatest... Jeremy Wells' you can't tell me that wasn't a self dig at not being the best taskmaster and knowing it.
57,x28a99_00058,Jeremy been meaner to Paul in the intros this season. Usually he's nicer. No fully lab based tasks this season
58,x28a99_00059,Nice to see the best friends come back.
59,x28a99_00060,Honey would lure me into a house for sex.
60,x28a99_00061,Still hasn't been posted for us non-New Zealanders. :( d-panel has been prompt with every episode until now.
0,xrgqq2_00001,"Not sold on this cast yet, tbh. Fern and Munya were most fun here, but I don't know if they were will be all time favourites. Certainly my favourites in S14 to date though, and a lot of fun. John I was unfamiliar with walking in and I don’t feel like that has changed much after this (though he was the standout in the quite subpar toilet roll task). Dara has always had a ""pleasant nothing"" sort of a vibe for me, and I unfortunately find Sarah Milligan quite annoying - but in both instances I am willing to be changed as I have been changed by previous Taskmaster contestant's appearances. The tasks themselves were solid enough if you ignore the aforementioned toilet task but definitely keen to see more creative tasks and more tasks that allow for lateral thinking."
1,xrgqq2_00002,I’m not sold on this team yet but I hope they grow on me. Already missing Ardal.
2,xrgqq2_00003,"Toilet roll task was crap, pun intended. Was pretty good otherwise though, I did enjoy that film task because even I who could see the items struggled to get the films"
3,xrgqq2_00004,I wrote a short film called PEAS. It even has an IMDB listing. Should John get a retroactive point?
4,xrgqq2_00005,This might be a stupid question since nobody else seems to be wondering it but: how do you book an entire airport terminal for a TV shoot? Don't people need to...use airports? Like all the time? How are there whole chunks of Gatwick just standing empty for people to come throw loo rolls around in?
5,xrgqq2_00006,"It seems like lots of people are criticizing the airport task as being stupid with no clever solution. I disagree... Unraveling and making small ""snowballs"" was a good option that only one person used... barely. An object with a higher mass (wet loo roll paper for instance) is definitely easier to throw with accuracy. Also your odds of success are significantly better if you split the tasks into smaller chunks. If anyone had done the wet paper strategy for the majority of their time they they would have almost certainly have won. It has to do with how the mathematical odds change. I'm surprised no one attempted unrolling the paper, tying the tube on to the end, stuffing it full of something ""relatively heavy,"" and then swinging it until the weighted end was in the toilet. From there I would thread the remaining rolls onto my improvised grappling hook roap and slide them down the line into the toilet. I'd probably braid a couple rolls worth of paper into an actual rope. There's often also some sort of hidden advantage close by as well, but none of the contestants tried anything except prayer. I've read a few good ideas about moving the dot as well, I can't remember if there was a rule preventing that, there often is. TLTR: I'd hardly say it was a bad task, just a lack of creativity from the contestants."
6,xrgqq2_00007,Why didn’t Dara get a big box head like the rest of them?
7,xrgqq2_00008,"Fern going ""Oh no..."" is like the anti-Chris Ramsey"
8,xrgqq2_00009,John Kearns really might have a whiff of the Kumar.
9,xrgqq2_00010,Not Munya quoting 10 year old vines
10,xrgqq2_00011,One of my favourite things about the later seasons is Greg just flagrantly ignoring that the scores for teams should add up to 5 and giving them whatever the fuck he feels like 😂
11,xrgqq2_00012,That loo roll was all rim and bounced out.
12,xrgqq2_00013,"OH, THAT'S WHY HE GOT SE7EN, RIGHT"
13,xrgqq2_00014,"Dara, John, and Fern are going to murder each other and I’m so here for it."
14,xrgqq2_00015,“For a bit of a laugh we borrowed the whole of Gatwick south terminal” God I love Alex
15,xrgqq2_00016,"Dara acting like an over-enthusiastic science teacher at the end with the other two going back in the house, is the genesis of their future failures."
16,xrgqq2_00017,Some people use half the time realising it's better if they're wet.
17,xrgqq2_00018,"'Stop saying kangaroo, my brain' Early contender for quote of the season"
18,xrgqq2_00019,I love that Greg has probably never seen the vine he’s now quoting repeatedly
19,xrgqq2_00020,Cheeky behind the scenes for this live task having been in the audience - Fern had quite a dramatic fall when she went up for her turn so had to go back and walk to it again
20,xrgqq2_00021,Sarah scratching her box head 😂
21,xrgqq2_00022,"""Is an eel a fish or a snake?"" Dying"
22,xrgqq2_00023,"YES, Munya childhood stories have commenced"
23,xrgqq2_00024,"As Nish predicted, John Kearns does indeed have a whiff of the Kumar."
24,xrgqq2_00025,Finally I can say I've visited a Taskmaster location.
25,xrgqq2_00026,RIP Fern Brady the chicken ❤️
26,xrgqq2_00027,"Alternate episode titles: ""Gravity Will Provide The Power"" ""Your Teeth Are On Your Lips"" ""The Australian Wizard"" ""LeBron James"""
27,xrgqq2_00028,Wow dara really doesn’t have the patience for team tasks.
28,xrgqq2_00029,"Hello again, Coors advert guy! I hate you."
29,xrgqq2_00030,Munya is going to do some great bullshitting this series I can tell.
30,xrgqq2_00031,Are we going to see an Acaster vs Gilbert level disagreement this series??
31,xrgqq2_00032,Fern being totally done with Dara and buggering off is a mood I'm here for!
32,xrgqq2_00033,"I cannot tell you how much I fucking CACKLED at Munya quoting the ""Lebron James"" vine over and over again while throwing loo rolls. That moment was basically two of my favorite types of humor colliding."
33,xrgqq2_00034,"Dara looked less out of character with the top hat, scarf, and hi vis vest than in that leather jacket."
34,xrgqq2_00035,When does an hour not feel like an hour? When Taskmaster is on. Final part already?!
35,xrgqq2_00036,"Was able to go to the recording for this one, it was great fun. It seemed like Dara was still in host mode from Mock the Week because he kept doing asides and jokes to the audience in the breaks. For the prize task, Munya said that a fan had made the woollen version of his head and only reluctantly sold it to him when he needed it for the prize task. He didn't say that until after the prize task and Greg said if he'd said that before he definitely would have got more points. For the film task, Greg joked how John had named such movie classics as 'Peas' and 'Moon'. John replied that Moon is a real film and then Greg said they would just cut out him getting it wrong. Fern argued that there was no way her and Dara could have got the Jars /Jaws clue because it only works with an English accent. Greg pretended he couldn't understand a word she was saying which got a huge laugh, then did some sort of Scottish / Irish accent, Dara looked appalled and Greg said 'don't worry, the edit will cut out any racism!' They did some retakes at the end, getting Sarah to say Bangle holder instead of dildo, getting John to say Guinness book of World records because he had kept saying it in the wrong order. Greg also redid his intros with French instead of Spanish because he had no idea how to to pronounce it."
36,xrgqq2_00037,Fanny Weapon is a completely different kind of film
37,xrgqq2_00038,"Imagine going back in time to Alex just after he'd done Taskmaster at the Edinburgh Fringe, and telling him that within the decade he'd be hiring out Gatwick South Terminal to do bits of the show in."
38,xrgqq2_00039,I feel like John Kearns is going to try so hard and yet fail at everything. No way he's not coming last
39,xrgqq2_00040,Dara and Fern are going to have a serious Irish/Scottish fight before the series is out. I can't wait
40,xrgqq2_00041,Munya and Sarah are the pairing I didn't know I needed
41,xrgqq2_00042,It’s such an unnecessary details but I love the different colouring of the loo rolls for everyone
42,xrgqq2_00043,"'I'll throw up it in the air, and therefore not really be able to aim or gauge how I would need to adjust' was one hell of a first strategy"
43,xrgqq2_00044,For a second I thought John might have been left on his own. Which would have been sad but also funny.
44,xrgqq2_00045,"But Greg, what did we learn today? I always looked forward to that line at the end of the episode. I hope it hasn’t gone away."
45,xrgqq2_00046,Anyone else think for a minute that the head box was just part of Sarah’s task outfit? I was shocked and delighted LOL.
46,xrgqq2_00047,"Fern is now gonna get me saying ""Aww no"" the same way Chris Ramsey said ""No way!"""
47,xrgqq2_00048,The flush shot was impressive.
48,xrgqq2_00049,I do love Fern’s outfit
49,xrgqq2_00050,Nuthatch nuthatch nuthatch!
50,xrgqq2_00051,"I feel like I'm going mad, please someone else tell me they could also see the bird Dara was referring to. Looked like an incredibly majestic looking swan with wings outstretched to me."
51,xrgqq2_00052,"I'm so ready for the inevitable super edit of Munya's ""in Zim"" stories."
52,xrgqq2_00053,I really enjoy that the 4 letter names are one team and the 5 letter names are another.
53,xrgqq2_00054,Dara's sigh when he was told to read the task.
54,xrgqq2_00055,"Nobody said anything about naming a species of bird or fish. So you could have just gone ""David the bird, David the fish, Sean the bird, Sean the fish, Jackie the bird, Jackie the fish, Millicent the bird, Millicent the fish."""
55,xrgqq2_00056,"Munya, calling on the spirit of LeBron James and being answered by Shaq’s free throw demon….."
56,xrgqq2_00057,Doing the colour version of the bird is amazing
57,xrgqq2_00058,"Whys Dara’s head normal, and everyone else is in boxes?"
58,xrgqq2_00059,"""LeBron James"" is not a catchphrase I was expecting from this task."
59,xrgqq2_00060,Got my Dara tinted glasses on but I can sort of see a badly disfigured swan.
60,xrgqq2_00061,Might make the screengrab of Dara with the middle finger my new screensaver
61,xrgqq2_00062,"Interracial JLS yet another alternative title name, this line up is already killing it!"
62,xrgqq2_00063,Someone please make a clip of aw no and no way merging into one
63,xrgqq2_00064,That plane hitting the seat was heartbreaking.
64,xrgqq2_00065,A team task? On episode 1?
65,xrgqq2_00066,Zimbabwe count: 3 (2Additional Alex Zims)
66,xrgqq2_00067,"Fern did not seem pleased to have to meet her teammates, haha. So relatable!"
67,xrgqq2_00068,"Did the first task confuse anyone? It read name ten films you are in, but then showed them handling the objects like the contestants were elaborated on what to do outside what was written on the task"
68,xrgqq2_00069,This was an all-time excellent opening episode.
69,xrgqq2_00070,Munya is giving me Ramsey-Love energy. Really excitable and eager to do the task but can also whip out the bullshit when the need comes.
70,xrgqq2_00071,"Hope to be in that airport one day so I can find the spot where the toilet went, they should put a shrine and let passengers throw some rolls"
71,xrgqq2_00072,John is an agent of chaos and I fucking LOVE IT.
72,xrgqq2_00073,"Great start to a season, everyone's banter in on point. I was disappointed that no one thought of anything particularly clever in the loo roll task; in my head I was picturing someone unrolling it and holding onto the first square, such that they can get it back if they miss their target. And I was certain they were saving John for last because he came up with something mind-blowingly brilliant. Poor John was so proud of his paper airplanes."
73,xrgqq2_00074,"I don’t think it’s unfair to say that Munya and Sarah are going to be a much more cooperative and effective team than Dara, Fern and John. But, it’s early doors, they’ve only just met. The letterers could still prove to be a solid team"
74,xrgqq2_00075,"The prize task was good, and I see Sarah's going to be the vulgar one of the series. I wasn't a big fan of the first task. It seemed overly complicated, though the boxes were a nice stroke. I love how you can tell Dara's facial expressions even when you can't actually see his face. Second task: It's very like ""land the eggs in the frying pan"" from series ten. Not much you can do except just chuck the toilet paper, but there were some great moments and it's interesting to see their different attitudes to it. John Kearns' toilet paper airplane had me doubled over laughing - the team did a great job editing that. The first team task! This was an amazing task. I was surprised to see Munya and Sarah together, but their dynamic is wonderful. The other team... Absolute chaos. You can see the bossy/competitive side of Dara coming out here. Both teams were so funny, and I was laughing through the entire task. The live task. It started a bit boring, but oh my god the tension towards the end. Thoughts on the contestants - I'm surprised to see Dara so competitive. And that chair is definitely too small for him. Fern is wonderful. I can't articulate exactly why, but she's my favourite contestant so far. Sarah is hilarious. And as evidenced in the prize task, the dirty mind of the series. She seems like such a nice person too. Munya's also very funny, but in a more restrained manner. Love him <3 John has great comedic timing, and his task attempts... I can see why the studio audience said he was one to watch, and I anticipate great things from him in the future. I thought the second half was better than the first, but overall a good episode! It had me crying with laughter at some points, and the lineup is one of the best I've seen. This is going to be a great series."
75,xrgqq2_00076,the NOISE Sarah's wet toilet paper made delighted me. I feel insane but I DO see Dara's bird turkey. Weirdly we got two unrelated Wizard of Oz references. Also PEAS!
76,xrgqq2_00077,"The toilet roll one was one of my least favourite tasks ever - there was nothing interesting to it, no real clever way of doing it, no rules to play with. You can either throw accurately or you can’t. It just didn’t seem inspiring and felt like they needed to use the Gatwick location. Loved the rest of the episode though and like Fern especially."
77,xrgqq2_00078,Dara is just going to lose it in every team task and it's going to be hilarious.
78,xrgqq2_00079,"Wow, they got Greg Davies to guest star on his own show?"
79,xrgqq2_00080,"I feel like it always takes me a few episodes to click with the new cast and understand the way their minds work, their group dynamics and their sense of humour (with the exception of s13 where the chemistry was instant!). But for me it felt like everyone went kind of route one with the tasks this week, and there wasn’t as much back-and-forth between them and TM as usual. It’s still fun though, and there’s potential for the Fern, Dara and John group to be hilarious chaos in future episodes!"
80,xrgqq2_00081,‘Wizard boomerang 2: a bendy stick that comes back to you’ was the best of the series
81,xrgqq2_00082,"If you unravel a length of loo roll, then thread it through the tube, you can create a pendulum and you would be able to swing it into the toilet like a ball on a string"
82,xrgqq2_00083,"""Is an eel a fish or a snake?"""
83,xrgqq2_00084,If they have a whole airport terminal for the location tasks and don't use a travelator I'll be very surprised
84,xrgqq2_00085,Alex loves birds.
85,xrgqq2_00086,Greg’s right; Dara’s face up on the live task stage is entirely one of “Why did I say yes to this?”
86,xrgqq2_00087,“I’m absolutely pissed on the adrenaline”
87,xrgqq2_00088,John Kearns is my favourite. Has a lovely way about him.
88,xrgqq2_00089,"Solid, SOLID opener."
89,xrgqq2_00090,I'm surprised nobody suggested that Dara's box head was actual size. They would have on Mock the Week...
90,xrgqq2_00091,They definitely had to cut away from Sarah sticking her ceramic dildo into Munya's wool mouth during the credits!
91,xrgqq2_00092,Fern is just lovely isn't she
92,xrgqq2_00093,"Great first episode. Judging by this ep, I'd say Fern and Sarah are early favourites to win. Sarah seems to have quite a straightforward, don't overthink it bosh style, but Fern seems to have the same slightly wild energy as Morgana and Sarah Kendall, so I think she has a very good chance. Dara has a bit of Hugh Dennis Dad skill, but also a bit of Hugh Dennis dodderiness, (as seen by him forgetting all films in the first task). John seems like utter chaos, so I imagine he'll get a lot of 5s and 1s. Munya is probably going to be good at the creative tasks but also seems a bit too straightforward to really excel."
93,xrgqq2_00094,"If they ever make Taskmaster Zimbabwe, Munya needs to be the TM and an episode should solely be dedicated to Bow and Arrow based tasks."
94,xrgqq2_00095,"I'm confused, wasn't the fella that hosts the show already called Dara Ó Briain?"
95,xrgqq2_00096,“Night night bot bot powder party” Man it’s good to be back
96,xrgqq2_00097,I feel like Fern will slowly descend into anger and madness like Bridget as the series goes on.
97,xrgqq2_00098,37 minutes for this show to break it's first contestant. Poor John :(
98,xrgqq2_00099,‘Is an eel a snake or a fish’ could have been the episode title
99,xrgqq2_00100,Munya and Sarah did a great job!
100,xrgqq2_00101,"I'm less than 2 minutes into the episode, and I guess it means being kind of an obsessive fan that I realize Greg is wearing a brand new pair of glasses lol"
101,xrgqq2_00102,"I just loved Sarah shouting Nuthatch. Nuthatch, Nuthatch, NUTHATCH"
102,xrgqq2_00103,"It seems very possible we'll get a fourth woman into CoC 3 at this rate: Fern and Sarah seem to be middling enough to at least score points on most tasks, with enough critical hits to score higher too. I thought Dara would be the butt of the jokes, but John ending up there is still hilarious too. I'm sure there'll be a drinking game with a sip (chug?) whenever Munya mentions Zimbabwe. Haha. I'm also interested to see if he'll get picked on as the youngest (by some margin, too) of the group, or if Greg finally got soft towards the youth. In all just as excited for this series as any other series. The production levels this series seem even more insane, too."
103,xrgqq2_00104,"Did anyone else find it awkward when John didn’t want to hold Munyas hand in the live task, it felt like he really left him hanging for a while."
104,xrgqq2_00105,I don’t dislike a single contestant at all so far. Usually in the first episode I know who I’m not so fussed on but pleasantly surprised how good this group feels and they seem to have gelled instantly.
105,xrgqq2_00106,There's surely some hidden element here. No way they wanted all 5 to just stand there and chuck all the rolls?
106,xrgqq2_00107,Alex looks like his pissing in the corner whenever he's stopped
107,xrgqq2_00108,"Brilliant from start to finish. Great contestants, great tasks, some superb team dynamics and a tense final task. Welcome back TM"
108,xrgqq2_00109,"Was Munya's ""funny story"" about his 9 gardeners not akin to Sharon Osbourne's ""funny story about sending her servants back into a house fire""?"
109,xrgqq2_00110,Munya's & Sarah's bird is actually good
110,xrgqq2_00111,"Honestly, noticing Fern Brady looking like she needed to wee throughout the entire team task was hilarious in and of itself. That discount superhero costume she was wearing was not her friend in that regard. Also, can already see John Kearns being the David Baddiel, Nish Kumar, or Johnny Vegas of this season."
111,xrgqq2_00112,"Props to the prop person, those heads are amazing"
112,xrgqq2_00113,"""Shut yer face"" The confusion followed by low-level aggression when Sarah gets an answer right is perfect"
113,xrgqq2_00114,"I love Sarah’s energy, just seems so friendly and nice"
114,xrgqq2_00115,"Oooo, I like the ""Supermun"" suit."
115,xrgqq2_00116,"If that plane had gone in, there would have been partying in the streets."
116,xrgqq2_00117,What a shot.
117,xrgqq2_00118,Fern and Dara acting like kids on their first day at big school
118,xrgqq2_00119,"Wasn’t sure fern had it with the chicken, but the story brought me round"
119,xrgqq2_00120,I thought that was just Sarah's task outfit for a moment
120,xrgqq2_00121,oh my god John is going to be an absolute disaster isn’t he
121,xrgqq2_00122,The Off Menu version of Munya has been unleashed early
122,xrgqq2_00123,This is amazing - is this when Gatwick was closed during the pandemic?
123,xrgqq2_00124,Dara O Briain has big James Acaster being completely over Rhod's bullshit energy
124,xrgqq2_00125,This group are fucking great
125,xrgqq2_00126,Excellent start. Potential to be one of the best series!
126,xrgqq2_00127,"It might just be me or does this series have a different feel? I feel like it’s gonna be a somewhat contentious series, where the vocal minority love it or hate it. Personally, I’m neutral for now, it’s too early to tell if it’s gonna be good or not. But I did like the first episode. It was really fun, especially the Toilet Paper Aeroplane Bathos. So I’m optimistic."
127,xrgqq2_00128,"I'm a fan of Sarah's from Would I Lie To You. She's adorable and crude and I love her. My husband and I are going to see her in America (where I live, haha) in April! Fingers crossed it doesn't get cancelled."
128,xrgqq2_00129,"There seems to be a bit of tension between Dara, Fern and John so I am curious to see what comes of that"
129,xrgqq2_00130,It didn't say on the task that they couldn't take the box heads off... right?
130,xrgqq2_00131,"Decent series starter, here's my thoughts and opinions on the episode. Prize Task: Simple but very open task idea. It's pretty bad that my first thought was a ball gag (as that would literally keep your jaw dropped). The fact Munya had to pay £200 for his own head was for me the most jaw dropping part. Task 1 (proper): Loved the big headed boxes, really not helping (big head) Dara there. The only film I didn't understand by the end was Se7en for number 10. (is that the one with the quote 'What's in the boxxx??') Task 2: Again a fairly straightforward task. Bit disappointed no one tried any loopholes. Didn't see anyone attempting to move the spot while standing on it. (I'm sure in 15 minutes you could try something). Plus if Alex would give Sarah some water, surely there's other things you can get him to do. Like how they keep the colours assigned for each contestant (a thing I think started in series 10). Task 3: A team task in episode 1??? Not quite sure about the split on this one. Munya and Sarah seem good, but Dara, Fern and John felt a bit stiff (I did laugh at their first meeting though being only slightly less awkward than Joe & Sian). The task was okay, I liked Dara's optimism that their drawing was still a bird (I definitely saw what he meant before he even described it). Felt like the crayon drawing over them did make the scoring a little more unfair though. Live Task: Another good task, I liked how long it took the seesaw to move, plus all the funky stuff the contestants wore was entertaining too. Non task notes: Yep, I like the circus theme. It's very in your face this time (bit like series 8 Japanese/Manga theme), the living room definitely seemed full of decorations. It'll be interesting to see if there are any circus related tasks, I'm hoping there's something if the theme is this prevalent, plus you've got to use that Lucky Dip by the caravan right?? The contestants all seem alright. Personally I'm rooting for Dara as he's the comedian I've seen the most, and I want seat 1 to have a winner. I'm not getting a proper connection between all of them quite yet, but plenty of time for that. Just thinking in comparison to stuff like series 10 which had them in hysterics before the prize task was over."
131,xrgqq2_00132,I already love every contestant. What a great cast.
132,xrgqq2_00133,"Somthing about this episode seemed.... Off? Anyone else feel that way? Something about the way it was shot, the cast seemed not as into it etc... I dunno. Don't get get me wrong, it's TM, so it was great aha. Just off."
133,xrgqq2_00134,"I didn't understand that se7en was the box reference and forgot it was said, would've liked it mentioned at the end of the task as a recap perhaps. Surprised nobody tried taking off the box head, maybe Alex put that in the task but they cut it from air since nobody tried. I agree with Dara that I could sort of see a bird in their image. Also Fern is becoming my favorite contestant thus far. Very excited to see how this series goes, everybody has been excellent (comedically, if not in the tasks) so far. I do think it has a bit of a different vibe than some of the earlier series (maybe since the overall fame of the contestants is higher?), but not in a bad way."
134,xrgqq2_00135,John clearly doesn't know what he's got himself into lol
135,xrgqq2_00136,"I would say it was a slow start task wise, but the cast already felt in place. Can't wait for the next episodes"
136,xrgqq2_00137,Petition to change the episode title to ‘Fanny Weapon’
137,xrgqq2_00138,This is egg helium territory
138,xrgqq2_00139,"Ok, I adore John already."
139,xrgqq2_00140,I'd never heard of John before this but I relate so hard to his task failure
140,xrgqq2_00141,Has there ever been a team task in the first episode? Exciting!!
141,xrgqq2_00142,Zimbabwe mention count: 3
142,xrgqq2_00143,"I like this bunch, I think it will be a good series"
143,xrgqq2_00144,Honestly the toilet task was the weakest for me because it was similar to a live task they did not even that long ago in season 12. That one they even made paper airplanes and granted there were other receptacles but many tried for the toilet. So it's like they say that and were like well let's just do a toilet and make it far away. Still enjoying the series though.
144,xrgqq2_00145,"Fern Brady chose a BDSM Dominatrix inspired latex catsuit and bustier (and her collar even reads ""Taskmistress""). She's also bisexual, and as far as I know, single. Do you think I have a shot?"
145,xrgqq2_00146,Oh Dara is definitely going to be this series’ Ardal picking apart other contestants’ efforts.
146,xrgqq2_00147,"I'm calling it now, Fern is going to win this series"
147,xrgqq2_00148,"Ah, the old Buckaroo/Jenga hybrid game which ends in a popped balloon...Of course!"
148,xrgqq2_00149,"I didn't hear that you couldn't remove your big head in the opening task, but in all honesty looking at the actual things didn't help me much, I'm crap on films. Does anyone have a good tactic for the loo roll task, other than wetting it? I've got nothing"
149,xrgqq2_00150,"So far, no one's spotted any (to me, obvious possible 'loopholes') which really surprised me and, tbh, annoyed me a bit bc that spices the show up a bit. (For example: Task 1: where did it say they couldn't take the box of? Task 2: my first thought was ""right, move the spot with you"" (I'm pretty sure it's movable, maaaybe there are even more spots underneath to make the journey easier?) 15 minutes would have been plenty to hop around on one foot, the other always on the mark, to find a bag for the rolls, collect them, get to the nearest lift, down and right next to the loo I feel Other than that: LOVE the fact that LAH and team can still come up with such original tasks after all these years and looking forward to the rest of the series!"
150,xrgqq2_00151,Greg’s delivery of “…having nine gardeners??” was A++
151,xrgqq2_00152,"I'm not sure how well this would work but my first thought was to partly unroll the toilet roll and dangle/throw it down, then you can reel it back if you miss."
152,xrgqq2_00153,Fern's outfit really does it for me
153,xrgqq2_00154,"okay for some reason I'd thought even by the end of the Prize Task that Sarah Millican was going to be the series winner here, and I've never felt more confident in such a prediction. can't fully articulate why, but I do and everyone else notice when Alex during the first playback task marked down the moment that Munya talked about Africa lol"
154,xrgqq2_00155,"Dara and Sarah know how to play the prize game, that was STRONG. Fern is delightfully deadpan so far."
155,xrgqq2_00156,Munya and Sarah’s actually looks good.
156,xrgqq2_00157,The construction worker’s Buckaroo
157,xrgqq2_00158,John Kearns is such a try hard. Which makes it funny that he's so shit
158,xrgqq2_00159,"Very glad to have taskmaster back, and what a great cast"
159,xrgqq2_00160,"I think Sarah and Munya are going to become a top tier team for me. Loved her already, already in love with him. Also, I disagree with Greg: I thought that bird was actually really great. Their use of Alex's pauses to accent features was clever, and honestly I could not have done better drawing normally."
160,xrgqq2_00161,"A hack for the bird/fish task that I only thought of afterwards, and may or may not have actually worked - stand behind alex before he uncaps the paint and say a bird so that he has to turn around and the paint doesn't go on the canvas, thus giving you some time to plan the drawing"
161,xrgqq2_00162,The lil paper airplane I’m dying
162,xrgqq2_00163,“It’s a fantastic piece of engineering.” Utter failure
163,xrgqq2_00164,Has anyone kept track of the LeBron James count?
164,xrgqq2_00165,What’s in theeee boooox what’s in the boooooxxxx
165,xrgqq2_00166,"Everyone knows you need to shout ""Kobe"" not ""Lebron James"""
166,xrgqq2_00167,TITLE CALL DRINK
167,xrgqq2_00168,What a great shot in the completely wrong place!
168,xrgqq2_00169,Team task in episode 1? Sacrilege!!!
169,xrgqq2_00170,I was really really hoping someone would throw one of their first rolls of toilet paper at the toilet and accidentally knock the seat down.
170,xrgqq2_00171,"Team Dara, John, and Fern already have quite a disagreement since their first team task! I wonder what their team dynamic will be in the next team tasks haha 😂 Munya and Sarah's team dynamic seems lovely"
171,xrgqq2_00172,"I absolutely love both Sarah and Dara, I think they're two of the funniest people ever. I don't know much about the other three, except that I immediately have a crush on Fern. I agree with what other people have said, that there seemed to be the possibility of loopholes in the first two tasks, but no one seemed interested in finding them. Like, there's no reason they couldn't have asked Alex to retrieve the thrown TP and have more tries at it."
172,xrgqq2_00173,"Munya really missed an opportunity with his prize task item. He could have said, this way, you can drop my jaw to the floor whenever you want."
173,xrgqq2_00174,"I'd have asked Alex for some tape and scissors. Assuming OK, I'd have cut the spot in half then taped a half to each foot. Now I can move while being on the spot. Should make the rest easier"
174,xrgqq2_00175,Dara going full physics with his loo roll
175,xrgqq2_00176,Does Dara have the French flag on his arm in this task after having the Irish tricolour on in the first one?
176,xrgqq2_00177,LeBron James LeBron James
177,xrgqq2_00178,"Coming back to the show after skipping the last series. 5 minutes in and Greg has already given 5 points for ""Most jaw dropping item"" to a photo of a chicken. Never change, Taskmaster"
178,xrgqq2_00179,"Dara is Rhod Gilbert, Fern is James Acaster and John is Phil Wang. Fern and John wanted to kill Dara so badly."
179,xrgqq2_00180,The toilet roll task was poor. Too little room for creative solutions and everyone just had to lob it. Boring. The one thing you might have done was try to slide downstairs on the spot but that's all.
180,xrgqq2_00181,Why hasn't Dara been given a box head?
181,xrgqq2_00182,Beautiful. But Shite
182,xrgqq2_00183,Jackson Pollock would love this task.
183,xrgqq2_00184,Brilliant start to the series. Plus my favourite won so what's not to like?
184,xrgqq2_00185,How did they manage to get the airport as a location?
185,xrgqq2_00186,"Greg needs a better make-up artist, his chin and neck were a normal colour but the rest was orange, couldn't stop looking at it. So happy TM is back!"
186,xrgqq2_00187,I hope someone took off their boxhead in the first task
187,xrgqq2_00188,So what was the boxhead movie?
188,xrgqq2_00189,I think I’ve been biased by Nish saying on the podcast that John Kearns “had a touch of the Kumar” about him 😂
189,xrgqq2_00190,That's one fine looking ceramic bangle holder!
190,xrgqq2_00191,Good luck with that prize for the bleeped version.
191,xrgqq2_00192,Sarah and Dara have started off strong which you don't normally see from the bigger name comedians
192,xrgqq2_00193,Accent game is STRONG
193,xrgqq2_00194,Nothing saying to keep the box on their head?
194,xrgqq2_00195,The magic of editing in that final task
195,xrgqq2_00196,This is going to be an exceptional series
196,xrgqq2_00197,"Dara, Fern, and John are going to be utter chaos as a team and I'm all for it! I'm also going to predict Fern will win overall. Gut feeling."
197,xrgqq2_00198,Taskmaster Puzzles & Fun.
198,xrgqq2_00199,I've spent most of today giggling like a loon over Munyas' parody songs. The Matt Hancock Affair one is genuinely a work of genius. I do hope he gets to sing a song as a task at some point!
199,xrgqq2_00200,The Dara head box is absolutely amazing
200,xrgqq2_00201,“I’m just angry at me” a quote for all of the seasons
201,xrgqq2_00202,Happy to be back chatting with you all Taskmaster friends!
202,xrgqq2_00203,Ferns brain works perfectly for taskmaster
203,xrgqq2_00204,Alex corpsing on task 1 is a good sign. 😂
204,xrgqq2_00205,"I think the thing I’m hoping for and looking forward to the most this series is Dara getting roasted. If nothing else, the comment section is already providing."
205,xrgqq2_00206,Poonami is too close to something else for me to make the tsunami link.
206,xrgqq2_00207,Jaws... fucking Jars/Jaws
207,xrgqq2_00208,Treating this whole series as a 10 hour episode of off menu
208,xrgqq2_00209,
209,xrgqq2_00210,Every time they cut to John in the studio he looks so happy to be there!
210,xrgqq2_00211,Why has John been isolated… are we getting a Nish basketball shot style edit?! Or is it a complete meltdown?
211,xrgqq2_00212,It's a fantastic piece of engineering and it falls gracefully!
212,xrgqq2_00213,Dara now starting to resemble Ian in team tasks…
213,xrgqq2_00214,LOVE the circus set dressing & music!
214,xrgqq2_00215,"Whelp, I'm too high for this straight out the gate."
215,xrgqq2_00216,I think I’ve seen Fanny Weapon
216,xrgqq2_00217,Fanny Weapon would make a good franchise
217,xrgqq2_00218,"Even being able to see what the clues were, they were still quite tricky."
218,xrgqq2_00219,They’ve singled out John… I’m guessing he has gone down the “wanky workaround” route. Edit: I stand corrected.
219,xrgqq2_00220,I wonder if you'd be able to just unroll the loo roll and lower it in from the top sheet?
220,xrgqq2_00221,Sarah definitely put that dildo in prize!Munya's mouth.
221,xrgqq2_00222,"The bird drawing task reminded me of patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time - trying to come up with bird/fish names while directing Alex. I wonder if you could have stuck with one bird, e.g. parrot, and one fish, e.g. salmon, and focused on where you wanted Alex to be."
222,xrgqq2_00223,"Fern Brady is my new favorite contestant. I have no idea what she's saying half the time but I could just listen to her all day. (She's not hard on the eyes either.) All I could think about the loo roll task was it's the embodiment of ""It'd be all rim and bounce out."""
223,xrgqq2_00224,Oh I've missed this
224,xrgqq2_00225,Strong contender for best opening task surely?
225,xrgqq2_00226,No one remembered the ballaflou.
226,xrgqq2_00227,"Which film did the head in the box represent? Blanked the answer, was gonna go back and check but deleted the recording like a muppet"
227,xrgqq2_00228,I thought that Greg was too nice overall. He even went easy on Alex some of the time. Not sure if this is what I want to see!
228,xrgqq2_00229,As a geordie I'm rooting for Sarah Millican. Although I started out rooting for Chris Ramsey last series and was instead won over by Bridget Christie in all her strange glory
229,xrgqq2_00230,Make Sexy!Greg our logo
230,xrgqq2_00231,Dara off to a strong start with the cartoon ahah
231,xrgqq2_00232,Fantastic start from Dara!
232,xrgqq2_00233,"Never thought I'd see what it would look like if Dara O'Briain was being born, but here we are"
233,xrgqq2_00234,IRL Big Head mode
234,xrgqq2_00235,I feel like I'm a kid again playing Goldeneye 007 and I've just activated Big Head Mode
235,xrgqq2_00236,Is this story real? That’s a lot of gardeners aha
236,xrgqq2_00237,For anyone wondering number 10 was Seven. John said it randomly at one point.
237,xrgqq2_00238,Counting mentions of Zimbabwe this series: 2
238,xrgqq2_00239,Everyone knows you're suppose to shoot a fade away and shout Kobe.
239,xrgqq2_00240,"“It’s not about your artistic direction, is it?”"
240,xrgqq2_00241,Greg has lost a lot of weight!!
241,xrgqq2_00242,Oh John.
242,xrgqq2_00243,Great start and my cheeks are aching with that end shot of Dara in team task!
243,xrgqq2_00244,Loving the Puritans on a building site look
244,xrgqq2_00245,What a Task
245,xrgqq2_00246,So what was the 10th film name based on the giant cube heads??
246,xrgqq2_00247,Loved Dara’s Bane jacket.
247,xrgqq2_00248,Havent seen yet but what’s over under the amount of times Sarah says “fuck off” this season or flicks the Vs at Greg?
248,xrgqq2_00249,"Dara turned into Dio Brando for a moment there: ""Oh? You're approaching me?"""
249,xrgqq2_00250,Has anyone figured out what the tenth movie with the box heads was supposed to be? It's driving me MAD.
250,xrgqq2_00251,"So wait. On TP task was to throw TP standing ON taskmaster circle and throwing TP onto the toilet... But the toilet too was on taskmaster circle... so they can just move down with all TP and throw all the TP into the toilet, huh?"
251,xrgqq2_00252,What was the 10 th movie
252,xrgqq2_00253,John's nan is going to be raging that he's given away his Christmas present.
253,xrgqq2_00254,Why is Dara's head not any bigger?
254,xrgqq2_00255,Surely should have been return to oz!
255,xrgqq2_00256,I love them already
256,xrgqq2_00257,What's in the box!?
257,xrgqq2_00258,"Sarah & Dara are both exactly how I thought they'd be so far. Not seen anything of the other 3 before, so it will be interesting to see them as the series progresses."
258,xrgqq2_00259,Lebron James.
259,xrgqq2_00260,LeBron James
260,xrgqq2_00261,I am loving this new line up.
261,xrgqq2_00262,When are the mods adding more user flairs? Think I’m ready to commit to fern
262,xrgqq2_00263,"Surely the easiest way to do this task is unroll the whole roll, hold onto the card board bit and see if you can then get the end (the start of the roll) into the toilet. You then pull the card board off off the toilet paper and you put other rolls over the toilet paper like they are sliding down a pole. Obviously some aim required still so it isn't pulling against the paper but still should be enough to guide it in."
263,xrgqq2_00264,I love John
264,xrgqq2_00265,Think johns forgot the task and just having fun with his planes
265,xrgqq2_00266,"That is a niche reference. I got it, but it's niche"
266,xrgqq2_00267,What an art task.
267,xrgqq2_00268,My jaw was clenched.
268,xrgqq2_00269,Only half way through but they're smashing it. So excited!
269,xrgqq2_00270,excellent opener! love the mix of personalities. Btw Fern did a little Q&A on her insta after the ep.
270,xrgqq2_00271,"The box head would make a great Halloween costume, save for the whole inability to see thing. You could put your own face and say that you’re a Minecraft character."
271,xrgqq2_00272,A well-oiled Greg 🤤
272,xrgqq2_00273,Class art that.
273,xrgqq2_00274,"I love that from Dara, what a start"
274,xrgqq2_00275,I see no difference with Dara
275,xrgqq2_00276,Dara looks exactly the same!
276,xrgqq2_00277,Wizard. Boomerang.
277,xrgqq2_00278,"Honestly, ""Peas"" made me laugh way too much."
278,xrgqq2_00279,Clearly fanny weapon should have been the episode title
279,xrgqq2_00280,I'd fucking love to try this task.
280,xrgqq2_00281,This feels like a task everyone would want to try
281,xrgqq2_00282,WHAT WAS THE TENTH CLUE?! FOR THE FIRST TASK? I'm losing my shit
282,xrgqq2_00283,Can someone tell me what Greg and Alex said in french!? 😅 Couldn't manage to get google to translate it for me!
283,xrgqq2_00284,Most excited I’ve ever been for a lineup
284,xrgqq2_00285,What a start to the prize task and the series itself!
285,xrgqq2_00286,Bitterly disappointed that Cirque De Tâche is not a real traveling circus. Next Taskmaster meet up event?
286,xrgqq2_00287,Got Frozen and am genuinely chuffed. I don’t know why
287,xrgqq2_00288,Clockwork Orange was the most obvious
288,xrgqq2_00289,Think i've seen Fanny Weapon somewhere on the web tbf.
289,xrgqq2_00290,"Surely that's ""War and Peas""."
290,xrgqq2_00291,Aww noo
291,xrgqq2_00292,I reacted physically to that miss. It hurt.
292,xrgqq2_00293,"I was having a bad day and hoped Taskmaster would cheer me up. Sadly, it didn't, and possibly for the first time ever. I'm not really gelling with the cast so far (I only knew of Dara and Sarah beforehand) and these weren't the greatest group of tasks to break them in with. Hopefully, this is just the depression talking and doesn't reflect where this series is heading. John's consistent failures were pretty relatable, though. And I liked Fern and her daring outfit. The edit for Sarah's ""bangle holder"" seemed perfectly constructed for the censored version. I really hope they're not discouraging the contestants from doing blue humor in order to fit the family friendly mold. Edit: Biggest laugh for me was ""Gundhi."""
293,xrgqq2_00294,LET'S DO THIS
294,xrgqq2_00295,Sarah Millican’s honk noise is in the intro. All is right in the world
295,xrgqq2_00296,I think the ceramic dildo wins this one. Even the shatter risk is yikes
296,xrgqq2_00297,What was the one with the jars?
297,xrgqq2_00298,Why can’t I restart the live programme on the All 4 website?! They let me do that the last time
298,xrgqq2_00299,Fern is a strong contender for slaying this brilliantly.
299,xrgqq2_00300,Why did he get a point for Sev7en?
300,xrgqq2_00301,Ohhh nooo
301,xrgqq2_00302,Very excited for John Kearns this series. Best part of Guessable week in week out.
302,xrgqq2_00303,I need a print of Dara's prize picture right now
303,xrgqq2_00304,Strong start by Dara.
304,xrgqq2_00305,So far I think Dara’s is the only one that’s jaw dropping. Wait no Sara’s just dropped hers as I typed this.
305,xrgqq2_00306,The boxes. Omg the boxes
306,xrgqq2_00307,Anyone else think the channel 4 audio is messed up? Voices seem low. Laugh track really loud.
307,xrgqq2_00308,"So I’m guessing their outfits are films and not their chosen attire, thought fern had been a bit brave"
308,xrgqq2_00309,"Welcome back everyone, dayum Fearne is good at this!"
309,xrgqq2_00310,Is one not just Cube?
310,xrgqq2_00311,Given 15 minutes...There's something they can get to make it really easy isn't there?
311,xrgqq2_00312,Thrilling stuff.
312,xrgqq2_00313,My opinion; should have been 2 and 1 point for the bird task both utter shite but one slightly better the An the other.
313,xrgqq2_00314,
314,xrgqq2_00315,Surely you can run down and get the ones you missed? You only have to be on the spot for the throw right?
315,xrgqq2_00316,No tie break for first place? Am I misremembering?
0,xxdz3o_00001,Dara bodied this but I'm still mad about his instructions. 90% of them weren't instructions.
1,xxdz3o_00002,"It might have been the editing, but I swear the whistle was delayed when Munya's duck situation, allowed more ducks to fall out. Any ducks that fell out after the whistle should have counted."
2,xxdz3o_00003,I would absolutely watch an entire hours-long show of Greg guessing words in that manner
3,xxdz3o_00004,"Could someone explain Greg's ""elastic band submarine"" joke? Neither me or my partner get it and 50% of us have a penis"
4,xxdz3o_00005,My disk .. isn’t hard .. it is
5,xxdz3o_00006,I think I watched a bad/unrepresentative episode being taped because (sort of spoilers?) I felt like Dara was so pissed off with Fern and John the whole time and especially when they had to do a team task together. But here he seemed to take everything they did in good enough spirits - that last live task was hilarious!
6,xxdz3o_00007,Wins every task Gets the bonus points Says the episode title Grand slam.
7,xxdz3o_00008,Crying at Fern and John offering Dara no assistance at all in the live task. He was so exasperated.
8,xxdz3o_00009,"When Nish said that John had a ""whiff of the Kumar about him"", I think he was being unfair. To himself. John is absolutely useless."
9,xxdz3o_00010,Best live task in ages. Putting Dara on a team with two agents of chaos has got me so excited to see the rest of the team tasks
10,xxdz3o_00011,Dara at 'Crashes more'. Moment of the series so far.
11,xxdz3o_00012,"""I didn't ask for an opinion, I just asked for a time."" Sarah is going to become my new favourite contestant"
12,xxdz3o_00013,That live task was fucking genius. So good
13,xxdz3o_00014,"""what that picture doesn't show is that I've got flippers for fucking hands"" get that in the quote book"
14,xxdz3o_00015,"""...oh, for children..."" The SHADE, Sarah, the sweet-voiced SHADE."
15,xxdz3o_00016,I love that John has the idea to make the treadmill slower to make it easier and makes everything somehow worse
16,xxdz3o_00017,Munya obviously never laminated in Zimbabwe with the 9 members of staff
17,xxdz3o_00018,This is my favourite ever final task
18,xxdz3o_00019,I love how every attempt of john’s is shit I’m crying laughing
19,xxdz3o_00020,"30 points. Damn, Dara. Dara 3O Briain."
20,xxdz3o_00021,"Loved that final task, particularly Fern."
21,xxdz3o_00022,Fern's brain is fascinating
22,xxdz3o_00023,"It's not just a whiff, John Kearns has the absolute stench of the Kumar"
23,xxdz3o_00024,Kerry Godliman would crush this task. Write a sign. Laminate it. BOSH
24,xxdz3o_00025,Jesus fucking Christ John😭😭I don’t think I’ve ever laughed this hard at a contestant
25,xxdz3o_00026,Dara despairing at his team is going to be a big part of this season I think!
26,xxdz3o_00027,If anyone hasn’t heard it there is a full exposition of the Vaseline bath story on Munya’s episode of Off Menu. Worth it
27,xxdz3o_00028,"""I don't wish to ascend vertically?"" would've made a great episode title"
28,xxdz3o_00029,"Twice in this episode, I thought ""I would do this"" and then John Kearns immediately did/said the exact thing I was thinking. A bit ego puncturing really."
29,xxdz3o_00030,Enormous hugeness was genius
30,xxdz3o_00031,"First bifurcating poo, and then desiccated skin. I have fallen in love with Fern Brady's unnecessarily extended vocabulary."
31,xxdz3o_00032,"The laptop catch killed me, loving johns energy"
32,xxdz3o_00033,That's one of the best live tasks in recent memory. Especially with John and Fern just completely not getting it while Dara tried his best to fix it lol
33,xxdz3o_00034,What breakfast is long… and meaty?
34,xxdz3o_00035,I've never been so disappointed as when that live task ended. Such fun. Needed at last 3 more rounds.
35,xxdz3o_00036,That royal marine advert reference was great
36,xxdz3o_00037,"John: ""what's in the sock? What's in there? What is that?"" Me: A lime!"
37,xxdz3o_00038,John is just pure vibes man
38,xxdz3o_00039,THE PHARMACISTS?
39,xxdz3o_00040,This final task is a brilliant parlour game. Gonna remember this one.
40,xxdz3o_00041,One of the all time great Taskmaster episodes? So excited for this season now after being a tad underwhelmed last week. I thought Dara would do well but DAMN.
41,xxdz3o_00042,"The printing task showed off their personalities nicely, Munyas action film excitement, Dara being a pedantic 90-year-old man overwhelmed by technology, and John being a nostalgic millenial and picking Wingdings with glee even though that has never brought on anything good. Imagine if Mike Wozniak had given himself the poo your pants instruction. John fails differently than anyone else on the show so far, he's not gleefully rubbish like Nish, he's more ashamed of himself. He's very... out there, but unlike Bob or Noel or Mike, it doesn't pay off for him :D He's like a highly booksmart Harvard student who has never seen the light of day and somehow manages to set his flat on fire when making a cup of coffee or something. Very learned, but wonderfully useless to an olympic degree ""I didn't ask for an opinion, just a time frame"" I loved the live task and the team dynamics, Dara is like the sensible dad with two children, one weirder than the other and he loves them, but can't help facepalming from time to time"
42,xxdz3o_00043,"I have NEVER laughed so much at a live task in all my life, the helicopter crashing into mountains had me cackling to the point where my 10mo old looked CONFUSED."
43,xxdz3o_00044,"When John said ""the pharmacist"" when talking about getting a rubber duck, I was pissing myself. Absolutely hilarious."
44,xxdz3o_00045,"So we all said ""Laminator!"" along with Greg and Alex, right?"
45,xxdz3o_00046,That final task felt like if a less angry Ed Gamble were teamed with two David Baddiels and ended up winning the task anyway. Maybe the funniest episode ever. Everybody is hilarious.
46,xxdz3o_00047,I'd watch half an hour of that game. Specifically half an hour of Fern.
47,xxdz3o_00048,Was anyone else at the studio recording of this episode and remembers a ton of masturbation references all of which seem to have been cut?
48,xxdz3o_00049,"why do I feel like John Kearns 100% would've been a person to have also asked the infamous ""am I the spider?"" question"
49,xxdz3o_00050,Dara winning every task? A first?
50,xxdz3o_00051,Dara might finally be the first first seat winner of the whole show
51,xxdz3o_00052,Love Fern just saying whatever pops into her head first
52,xxdz3o_00053,Best live task since the wow monster. Incredible.
53,xxdz3o_00054,Dara used science and dominated. His big head is far superior and protected from alzheimer's
54,xxdz3o_00055,One of my favourite episodes ever. I was struggling to breathe from laughing more than once.
55,xxdz3o_00056,"Lost it a few times in this one, but especially in that live task. Which aircraft crashes more into mountains? This lineup is delivering as well as expected, even with lofty expectations to begin with."
56,xxdz3o_00057,"Dara really is the bright kid forced to do the group presentation while being saddled with the two class fuck-ups this season, isn't he?"
57,xxdz3o_00058,Dara's lost it
58,xxdz3o_00059,"I haven’t laughed as hard at Taskmaster as I did during that live task in a good while. It’s always good, but this was tears down the cheeks good."
59,xxdz3o_00060,"Sarah's extended megamix of ""I will survive"" was hilarious. ~~go on now, go, walk out the door, turn around now, BUGGER OFF~~ I would've gone for dear old Rick myself. Don't give up on Alex, don't let Alex down, don't run around, don't hurt Alex..."" Also - first clean sweep in the history of Taskmaster!"
60,xxdz3o_00061,"Fern, you are fucking weird."
61,xxdz3o_00062,"I had a mouth full of scotch when Fern said ""crashes most"" in the live task. That hurt like hell."
62,xxdz3o_00063,"This episode was a masterclass by Dara Ó Briain that upcoming competitors will need to watch. So much brilliance! And my goodness, when you think they couldn't have thought of more brilliant tasks after 13 series, they totally outdo themselves! I loved the grape and flour task especially, because it was a combination of a task intended to mislead (i.e., the best desert task presented next to a pile of sweets in TMNZS1) and a hidden key to victory task (i.e., potato bridge task from S2). I love this cast so far! Dara is so methodical, Fern is chaotic (and has a catchphrase), John is endearingly shit at everything (and is probably giving Nish Kumar a run for his money at being the shittest of all time), Munya randomly brings up Zimbabwe anecdotes that no one asked for, and Sarah is just her hilarious self."
63,xxdz3o_00064,This screams two part task
64,xxdz3o_00065,Fern I'm actually dead 😂😂
65,xxdz3o_00066,A big improvement on last week's episode imo
66,xxdz3o_00067,"Last week, I was kinda uncertain, thinking the show had a different feel to it. This week, it had the same old taskmaster feel to it. To quote my dad, “The Second Episode Is Always Better”, and I completely agree. Thought at first the laminator task was a bit boring but the twist made it. The rest were all fairly standard for me, but that live task was incredible! Had pretty much everyone in my family laughing. Only complaint is that Sarah and Munya are getting shown together too much. I hope they get their own spotlights soon."
67,xxdz3o_00068,"""I can't see me pockets because of me tits"""
68,xxdz3o_00069,"Fucking hell I love John Kearns, literally never heard of him before but fucking hell."
69,xxdz3o_00070,Lovely use of the word bifurcate.
70,xxdz3o_00071,Prescription ducks.
71,xxdz3o_00072,If Dara gets a perfect episode I don't know what I'll do
72,xxdz3o_00073,"Best live task they’ve ever done, amazing"
73,xxdz3o_00074,"We need more comments about John talking about ducks, I laughed so hard"
74,xxdz3o_00075,Dara is like the good chaotic version of Hugh really. Kudos to the enormous hugeness win!
75,xxdz3o_00076,Still giggling about 'crashes more' and 'into mountains' today.
76,xxdz3o_00077,Anyone else shout back “I put it to you!” when Greg says “I put it to you John”?
77,xxdz3o_00078,"This episode felt like an instant classic, amazing stuff all throughout! Can't believe nobody took their buckets ""off"" but I loved Munya's bath and Dara's bag techniques! Did Dara just get the highest episode score ever? Edit: this is my favorite episode across all seasons so far"
78,xxdz3o_00079,"Despite loving all of the contestants, I was kinda lukewarm on episode 1. But episode 2 blew me away. That was incredible. I've gotta say, the seat sign task was one of the most obvious twist double tasks in the show's history and I'm kinda shocked that not a single one of them predicted it. The final task absolutely killed me. I snorted water out of my nose multiple times during that task. That'll teach me to take a drink during taskmaster. I was 100% prepared for this series to let me down. Last series was so incredible and it's been a while since we've had a series that wasn't great, so I was prepared for the worst. But this is very much not the worst."
79,xxdz3o_00080,The one hour of the week where I can forget about all of the bullshit going on in the world
80,xxdz3o_00081,"A perfect ep for Dara, a perfect ep for us viewers. An instant classic."
81,xxdz3o_00082,One of the best episodes of all time. The live task made me laugh hearty belly laughs.
82,xxdz3o_00083,"That was an amazing episode! Loved how many ways there were to approach the ducks & socks task, really nice to see such divergent approaches I love how in the team task you can see how not on the same page Dara, Fern, and John are! (I'm looking forward to their team's antics in future team tasks!) Dara is smashing it! Hoping he breaks the first chair curse."
83,xxdz3o_00084,"John goes straight to my list of most adorable contestants along with Sian, Charlotte, Mawaan, Mel, Joe Thomas and Ardal (when he wasn't being a backstabbing snake lol) EDIT: How could I forget Johnny Vegas lol"
84,xxdz3o_00085,Dara flicking that cup away is the absolute height of physical comedy.
85,xxdz3o_00086,"The live task was amazing, I could’ve watched that all day 😂"
86,xxdz3o_00087,"""Print, laminate and distribute the most signs. Each of your signs must be placed on a different seat and all your signs must have a different instruction."" If the points were closer, I would have been Gamble-yelling for Fern's disqualification over the triple ""warm your bum""!"
87,xxdz3o_00088,"Fern's choice of words in the live task makes me wonder if she has the ""sabotage your team"" task from TMNZ."
88,xxdz3o_00089,"This is the best episode we've ever had. Absolutely brilliant, laughed the entire hour non-stop, even while writing comments during the ad breaks. Dara's ""the instruction is on the sign"" snap back to Alex is a hugely underappreciated win. The same man who can both laminate and collect rubber ducks. He worked hard for his clean sweep and he earned it."
89,xxdz3o_00090,"Feels like I just watched an all-time great episode; The duality of Dara's brilliant clean sweep contrasted with John's disastrous blundering through every task, Fern imagining bifurcating a poo and operating on a desiccated old man and an excellent final task to top it all off."
90,xxdz3o_00091,"Taskmaster in a nutshell. There’s a computer, printer and laminator on a table, and everyone loses their shit over the laminator"
91,xxdz3o_00092,There’s always someone each season you don’t know who blows it away. John is that person. Absolutely brilliant.
92,xxdz3o_00093,"So Dara has either had a mental breakdown, topped all the flour off or he found the grapes"
93,xxdz3o_00094,Series Zimbabwe mentions count: 4
94,xxdz3o_00095,Is that the first 30 points there’s been?
95,xxdz3o_00096,21 is a pretty good score from Munya but Dara just absolutely mental
96,xxdz3o_00097,I'm already thinking that Dara may make CoC III but I've fallen in love with Fern and Munya
97,xxdz3o_00098,"Since I first discovered Taskmaster I had 3 people in mind that I wanted to do it. Lee Mack, Rob Brydon, and Dara O'Briain (I thought it was fairly obvious David Mitchell wouldn't do it). Dara is now on, and he has not disappointed. After the first 15 points this episode I thought ""Huh, he could go perfect"". Then he kept winning and kept winning. By the end I was jumping out of my seat when Greg missed the Dungarees 50/50. I know Taskmaster isn't about the winning, it's about the comedy, but it does feel good when the person you're rooting for in a given thing does so well, and accomplishes something that's never been done before. I never thought someone would beat Adrian Chiles' performance, but wow that was impressive. It's way too early to judge the whole series, but this may have been my favorite TM episode ever."
98,xxdz3o_00099,Was Dara having a perfect episode/clean sweep the first time that's been done? (Also my math could be wrong but did Dara also get a bonus 2 points during the last task or were them points for matching up the socks?)
99,xxdz3o_00100,The live task had me HOWLING!
100,xxdz3o_00101,"Oh man, I was thinking all this episode that it could be my favorite episode in a long time, but the live task could knock it down… then the live task happened."
101,xxdz3o_00102,"I would confidently rank this inside the top 10-20 Taskmaster episodes ever. Amazing contestants, great tasks, Greg and Alex in top form. Was basically laughing all the way through! Also… can’t exactly put my finger on it, but the sheer craziness of the tasks and banter in this episode kinda reminded me of the early seasons. It’s very refreshing when no contestant tries to play a certain “character” and everyone just has a genuinely funny and determined go at the tasks."
102,xxdz3o_00103,"Just chiming in that this was my favourite episode of taskmaster for a looooooong time x Edit: wrote this before I even got to the final task, fucking incredible"
103,xxdz3o_00104,"An absolute power house performance from Dara this week. Perfect run, a Taskmaster first"
104,xxdz3o_00105,Grapes in the door is insanely genius
105,xxdz3o_00106,Dara fulfilling his prophecy as Gru
106,xxdz3o_00107,That final task was hilarious. I absolutely adore Fern.
107,xxdz3o_00108,
108,xxdz3o_00109,Is that the first perfect game in the show's history?
109,xxdz3o_00110,John Kearns laughing face first in a tipped over plate of flour feels...perfect.
110,xxdz3o_00111,I lost it at John going full Scarface with the flour
111,xxdz3o_00112,How did this end up being the funniest episode ever? My wife and I were in tears.
112,xxdz3o_00113,"I didn't know how I feel about Kearns during the 1st ep but when he went on about fonts this episode, I'm interested lol Also that live task is just hilarious. THE HELICOPTER LMAOOOO"
113,xxdz3o_00114,"John is killing me, definitely my fav"
114,xxdz3o_00115,"Phenomenal episode and I think that is because it feels like the cast is connecting. The live task helicopter stuff just slayed. Fern Brady and Dara should have a show together. Individually they all had us cracking up: I can't see my pockets from Sara Millican and I think that Munya's energy is infectious. The Zimbabwe riff is this years ""so I haggled for it."" Can't wait for next thursday."
115,xxdz3o_00116,"Just when I thought Fern's costume couldn't get any better, I see she has a ""Taskmistress"" belt buckle. Nice! The live task could have gone on for longer. It was hilarious!"
116,xxdz3o_00117,So Dara is going to win the series by at least 40 points. Got it.
117,xxdz3o_00118,John going for the scarface method of getting grapes out of flour
118,xxdz3o_00119,I think dara achieved the highest episode score since Katherine Ryan in a Pistachio Eclair
119,xxdz3o_00120,I was so confused that the sign behind them in the sign task said Sicily when i swear it said Silly when they entered. Ok I watched it again and you can see it flip at 7:29/7:30. I wasn’t imagining it lol.
120,xxdz3o_00121,"Was really anticipating this episode since seeing the episode title last week, & after episode 1. So I woke up & got into work extra early just to watch the episode. I was crying laughing so hard that the only other co-worker asked me whether I was okay. One of the best episodes in recent memory (which is saying something because everything lately has been incredible!) Also I think we’ve learned that it takes the Taskmaster himself participating to show us how it’s done & get a perfect score. Now I’m even more excited for the rest of the season. Hoping poor John doesn’t get the Judi Love/Justine Smith fate"
121,xxdz3o_00122,TIL Dara the physicist has no idea how technology works.
122,xxdz3o_00123,That Submarine line from Greg killed me.
123,xxdz3o_00124,If fern had shit herself and created a cleanly bifurcated poo that would have been television history. Now that’s a watercooler moment
124,xxdz3o_00125,"I'm not exactly sure Alex will have been thrilled with Fern stating in a roundabout way that she was somewhat bored during multiple tasks lol oh and 100% did NOT notice until this episode that Fern's got ""TASKMISTRESS"" plastered on her outfit"
125,xxdz3o_00126,"Holy crickey, Munya’s last-second duck and sock collapse was almost Joe’s potato levels of tragedy."
126,xxdz3o_00127,"Laughed throughout the whole episode. Definitely needed that! Very glad for Dara's win! I expected him to have a closer performance to Lee Mack since they got mentioned as the two dads who came on to the show because their kids are fans of Taskmaster, plus in his interview he said he dreamt about redoing some tasks so in all honesty, I thought he would be shite. All of that together made the clean sweep even more amazing! Also I've been wanting for a while now a task I can do with friends that wouldn't require a lot of stuff or space since we all have small apartments, and the live task is the PERFECT TASK for that! Definitely gonna try getting my friends to do it."
127,xxdz3o_00128,I didn't know anything about any of these contestants and after the first episode I didn't think this was going to be a very strong season but dang did this episode prove me wrong. That was an amazing live task. I love the teams they are in. I have a feeling I'm going to end up in love with this cast by the end.
128,xxdz3o_00129,That live task had me literally crying with laughter.
129,xxdz3o_00130,"30 points has to be a record for an episode, right? Dara is so clever man."
130,xxdz3o_00131,"That was an absolutely classic episode which played all the hits. Very specific prize task, a double task (with a laminator!), a hidden short cut task, a duck task and a great team live task featuring Greg. Bonus points for mercilessly bullying John!"
131,xxdz3o_00132,Ferns oooh nooo is going to be catchphrase for me
132,xxdz3o_00133,Fern just killing dara
133,xxdz3o_00134,This weeks team task is the opposite from last week. Fern and John are holding Dara back
134,xxdz3o_00135,"Bit late but oh well. Wasn’t sure about this season when I saw the line up, I was a fan of Dara and Sarah and was aware of Fern. But this is absolutely cracking me up so far. Even if John’s putting on an act it’s a spectacular one, Fern is chaos. Munya’s immense over confidence is great. Dara is hilarious as always and it’s great to see him in a different environment to presenting. And Sarah’s positive attitude mixed with her quick wit is a joy to watch. It’s making for a brilliant mix so far."
135,xxdz3o_00136,Greg being genuinely touched by Fern’s love letter story lmao
136,xxdz3o_00137,Maybe hot take but I still think Sarah is going to win the series. Her thoughtful tasking style I think will ultimately swing it in her favour.
137,xxdz3o_00138,Am I nuts? It feels like Sarah and Munya's videos have been paired for every task so far in the series.
138,xxdz3o_00139,"Forget setting a favorite contestant's name as my flair. I want mine to be ""I wish not to ascend vertically?"" Though I'd also accept ""Which breakfast is long and meaty?"" Or, of course ""Which aircraft crashes more into mountains?"""
139,xxdz3o_00140,"I'm loving the pairing of Munya and Sarah, they are hilarious. Not sure Fern is going to survive this episode, Dara is going to murder her."
140,xxdz3o_00141,John messing around with fonts is brilliant
141,xxdz3o_00142,"""Technology's just like breathing to me."" Technology: ceases to breathe"
142,xxdz3o_00143,One of the best eps of all time. And no it’s not recency bias!
143,xxdz3o_00144,John is clearly not in the game to win
144,xxdz3o_00145,"There have been several episodes that have made just about buckle over in laughter, but this is one that left me watery-eyed from Prize to Stage."
145,xxdz3o_00146,"really pretty much the only reason I haven't bothered to make Fern's ""oohh nhoooo"" my text alert sound is I don't know how to do that"
146,xxdz3o_00147,I always feel so bad for contestants like John who come off as super dumb in tasks. I wonder if that keeps a lot of celebrities/comedians from being on the show.
147,xxdz3o_00148,Fun to see them acknowledge the marvel character for the first time
148,xxdz3o_00149,Dara has the energy of a dad at a family party and I love him for it
149,xxdz3o_00150,John is so amazingly quotable
150,xxdz3o_00151,Jesus tapdancing christ Dara is absolutely on fire
151,xxdz3o_00152,"I was hoping their question for massive would be ""How would you describe Dara's head?"""
152,xxdz3o_00153,That ep had me in stitches multiple times. I don't think I'll ever forget how long it would take John from one end of the conveyor belt to the other!
153,xxdz3o_00154,Fern's reaction to Dara's prize task description was so visceral. So funny.
154,xxdz3o_00155,"I nearly choked on my breakfast fruit snacks after I heard ""crashes more"""
155,xxdz3o_00156,Watching this episode made me realize that the show can be described as “Mr. Burns and Smithers force the kooky residents of Springfield to compete in absurd tasks for a worthless prize.”
156,xxdz3o_00157,Holy shit that has to be the funniest episode ever! Couldn’t stop laughing.
157,xxdz3o_00158,I was disappointed with Dara's prize task. I know it's ridiculous but I was genuinely expecting him to pull out his entire shin bone or something.
158,xxdz3o_00159,Live laugh gin is definitely on a sign somewhere
159,xxdz3o_00160,Balance in the bath covered in Vaseline task for Series 17
160,xxdz3o_00161,The final task was the pinnacle of the show
161,xxdz3o_00162,"Holy fuck, Dara! 30 points you Irish god!!!!"
162,xxdz3o_00163,"Excellent episode, great tasks and the group is gelling nicely. Individually they are giving deranged results"
163,xxdz3o_00164,"""It's like the Royal Marines advert"" 😂"
164,xxdz3o_00165,Who else said “laminator” out loud along with Greg and Alex?
165,xxdz3o_00166,"Love that they had hidden grapes, classic taskmaster proving once again, that contestants don’t watch it before aha"
166,xxdz3o_00167,All that gaming has given Munya cat-like reflexes. Dead cat-like reflexes.
167,xxdz3o_00168,"Chris Ramsey seems to be right from last weeks pod, Dara is gonna smash this season."
168,xxdz3o_00169,That was genuinely one of my favourite Taskmaster episodes ever!
169,xxdz3o_00170,"I am in pain from laughing so hard. I watched that final task over and over again, it was so good."
170,xxdz3o_00171,that live task had me laughing the hardest for quite some time
171,xxdz3o_00172,Dara with the clean sweep! Very impressive!
172,xxdz3o_00173,"If Fern says she's the Crownéd Mother of Ducks she's the Crownéd Mother of Ducks, I don't make the rules."
173,xxdz3o_00174,'In Zimbabwe' Drink!
174,xxdz3o_00175,Dara's on his own again. Is he going to get maximum score this week?
175,xxdz3o_00176,"Man, I wanna add the gif of Greg and Kerry going ape shit over Laminator to this thread."
176,xxdz3o_00177,"Just catching up on this episode, wow! It was brilliant! Every task had a twist/shortcut to it and the studio task was amazing. Loved the laminator throwback, Dara winning 5/5 tasks is remarkable!"
177,xxdz3o_00178,Was he looking at wingdings or webdings?
178,xxdz3o_00179,"Munya’s hubris is his downfall, poetic"
179,xxdz3o_00180,PHARMACIST
180,xxdz3o_00181,Is John Kearns the new David Baddiel? It's feeling that way...
181,xxdz3o_00182,Dara's big brain is shining through this week. Faultless.
182,xxdz3o_00183,"John, Fern, do not fuck this up for Dara."
183,xxdz3o_00184,"That was so amazing! You can rewatch taskmaster episodes all you want, nothing beats that first laugh. I wish taskmaster was ok allll the time."
184,xxdz3o_00185,"I was thinking of asking on this sub before the season started whether people thought they'd enjoy a season of Taskmaster in which one competitor legitimately dominated throughout. It's early days, but we might test that question this series. I'm pretty sure I'd still be interested. Workshopping John's prize task, it may have worked better if he threw in some more highbrow books and presented them all as a category: ""The books I bought to make myself look smart but actually haven't read"", it might have been more well received. If it were me, my submission would be ""87 unread copies of The New Yorker""."
185,xxdz3o_00186,The abandoned airport is just the coolest taskmaster venue hope they can find something else as cool next season
186,xxdz3o_00187,"Right, so they're definately gonna have to carry out all the instructions they make up, yeah?"
187,xxdz3o_00188,You never forget your first lamination
188,xxdz3o_00189,Simultaneously find Munya funny and don't like him.
189,xxdz3o_00190,"Not for the first time this episode, let alone season I've audibly gone ""Oh John..."""
190,xxdz3o_00191,HOW HAS DARA NOT SEEN THE GRAPES
191,xxdz3o_00192,"They were doing so well, and now you can see Dara's pain."
192,xxdz3o_00193,"30 points Jesus, has anyone had that high a score in an ep?"
193,xxdz3o_00194,"LIve, laugh, gin? would have been a great alternative title for this ep"
194,xxdz3o_00195,Been a while since we've seen the garage. I'm thinking the one where they had to make the weather in series 11?
195,xxdz3o_00196,"Dara had the brilliant idea of going to the kitchen, only to miss the easier option of going for the ones in the garage door."
196,xxdz3o_00197,I can't breathe...
197,xxdz3o_00198,Such a funny episode and this is the first time I’ve been following the live Reddit chat along with the show. So hilarious and I was getting a second doubly hard laugh at all your responses. Just perfect. Hope to see you all again next week
198,xxdz3o_00199,Loved this episode. Was in stitches multiple times throughout the episode. I hope John keeps this level of general hopelessness up because I think he might beat Joe Wilkinson for best 'worst' contestant.
199,xxdz3o_00200,"Probably not the first one to ask, but was this the first time someone's ever had a perfect episode?"
200,xxdz3o_00201,A LAMINATOR
201,xxdz3o_00202,Lmao Fern's reason for laminating the love letters was so sweet that it even warmed Greg's heart
202,xxdz3o_00203,Bifurcate 😂😂😂
203,xxdz3o_00204,“Ducks go in the front bucket” “obviously” that is hilarious omfg
204,xxdz3o_00205,Kearns is channelling some Baddiel/Parkinson vibes here
205,xxdz3o_00206,Kearns is sensational
206,xxdz3o_00207,Could you do what Munya did and then just pick them out the bath and put them in the buckets?
207,xxdz3o_00208,"Devious tasks, and I like the line up so much. Sarah Millican is such a joy. Comedians are really kind this series."
208,xxdz3o_00209,Dara must be the highest scoring contestant in one episode
209,xxdz3o_00210,Dara in this reminds me of when your dad got angry at you at the kitchen table doing maths homework
210,xxdz3o_00211,"That was a good episode. I especially enjoyed the team task at the end, one of the best ones."
211,xxdz3o_00212,John Kearns is the nearest thing to Paul Choudhury since Paul was on in series 3. Superb
212,xxdz3o_00213,This must be a two-part task
213,xxdz3o_00214,I’m crying with laughter before the first ad break. This feels like an incredibly strong first 15 minutes
214,xxdz3o_00215,Is 15 points after two tasks an all-time record?
215,xxdz3o_00216,John's grape extraction method reminds me of a game I played as a kid where you had to stick your face in a bowl of flour and try and get as many sweets as possible
216,xxdz3o_00217,I love that they’ve separated dara out again for the second time this ep
217,xxdz3o_00218,On the taskmaster podcast since the lineup has been announced a few weeks back every time they bring up Dara they suggest he will use his brain and be the leader in points. Well I’ll be damned but they know their fellow comedians really well. John is a bit of a nish and fern is James Acaster
218,xxdz3o_00219,"I’ve kept my tonsils too, Alex."
219,xxdz3o_00220,Leave your husband 😂
220,xxdz3o_00221,No that's exactly what it said.
221,xxdz3o_00222,If Fearn had done a shit that soaked through her unitard and then split into two shits then task master would have peaked.
222,xxdz3o_00223,"John, fucking hell. Is he going to be the lowest scoring contestant ever 😂"
223,xxdz3o_00224,What the fuck John 😂
224,xxdz3o_00225,I love John so much
225,xxdz3o_00226,I think this has been the best opening two episodes in the shows history. Absolutely brilliant
226,xxdz3o_00227,What a great episode 👏
227,xxdz3o_00228,"Jesus, is this the greatest series ever? Very strong opening episodes."
228,xxdz3o_00229,"But seriously, what did Greg mean by the submarine comment? I took it as him basically tying an elastic band round his balls but I dunno if I missed anything."
229,xxdz3o_00230,I’m pretty sure it’s because I’m also Scottish but I love Fern!
230,xxdz3o_00231,I love the contestant studio outfits! I wonder if they are coordinating on purpose?
231,xxdz3o_00232,John is proving to be my runaway favorite for this series
232,xxdz3o_00233,"I don't think Dara deserved full points in the laminator task. One of his instructions was just ""The Gruffalo!"" (you can actually see it in the show) but that's not an instruction. If this isn't counted as correct, he would get second place behind Munya and receive 4 points instead of 5, ruining the clean sweep."
233,xxdz3o_00234,"In the live task, Munya was clearly going for the same type of thing I was thinking, but Sarah didn't catch it: ""How is the word ____ pronounced?"" gets you the point every time."
234,xxdz3o_00235,Fern kinda laughs like Elmer Fudd and I swear to god if the sheer joy and beauty of that could be converted into energy it would run the whole goddamn planet for a decade
235,xxdz3o_00236,"Really really good episode today. So far, I feel like 14 could be the best series in a while"
236,xxdz3o_00237,"I thought it might've seemed a little overkill if I'd created another fresh post just for these GIFs, so for now I'd just link them here in this thread I made two close up reaction ones, one with just Dara and one with Dara and Fern, I'm honestly not sure which looks funnier, you guys decide https://giphy.com/gifs/shocked-taskmaster-dara-obriain-YYtAiS3mqCCs366dDC https://giphy.com/gifs/taskmaster-fern-brady-dara-obriain-69ldL97cPoHYd0bsgM I actually made several more than that, from the first episode, so just click on the screen name on those pages I guess to see all of the ones on the profile. hope you enjoy!"
237,xxdz3o_00238,"This task has generated so much conversation in my house, we are a house of laminator enthusiasts!"
238,xxdz3o_00239,What the fuck is he doing to that poor lamininator
239,xxdz3o_00240,Big head move from Dara
240,xxdz3o_00241,Excellent duck catching from Munya there!
241,xxdz3o_00242,4 Zims in the series
242,xxdz3o_00243,Zimbabwe mention of the week!
243,xxdz3o_00244,Munya talked about vaseline in the bath on his episode of Off Menu
244,xxdz3o_00245,Tall person advantage on the duck sock sorter
245,xxdz3o_00246,Dara might have won this episode.
246,xxdz3o_00247,"Dara Channeling his inner Stargazing Live with ""enormous hugenes"""
247,xxdz3o_00248,Fucking genius
248,xxdz3o_00249,Gonna be bad if Dara blows such a commanding lead. Kind of feeling this season might be him or Sara
249,xxdz3o_00250,
250,xxdz3o_00251,Hoe many points did Sarah get in the prize task? I just watched it but thought they missed her. I'm running a fever so may just be confused. Thank you
251,xxdz3o_00252,Munya is 2/2 on excellent jackets so far.
252,xxdz3o_00253,LOVE YOU TRONKY
253,xxdz3o_00254,Pretty sure Young Pablo is dead.
254,xxdz3o_00255,Kerry would be delighted by this task
255,xxdz3o_00256,Finally a laminating task!!! Kerry will be jealous
256,xxdz3o_00257,So is this... admin as a task?
257,xxdz3o_00258,You think the science guy would know how to use a word document
258,xxdz3o_00259,"I thought the first episode was a bit weak, but this already feels like a HUGE step up from last week. John is going to be a trainwreck this season isn’t he?"
259,xxdz3o_00260,Poor John.
260,xxdz3o_00261,Could you imagine a John Kearns and Paul Choudhary team task?
261,xxdz3o_00262,John recreating the Elmo meme here.
262,xxdz3o_00263,Anyone notice the Silly Sicily sign changing ?
263,xxdz3o_00264,Johns buckets are sooo low
264,xxdz3o_00265,I automaticly judge people in tasks like this but then need to reality check my self that my clumsy dyspraxic arse could never
265,xxdz3o_00266,He meant farm-acy obviously
266,xxdz3o_00267,This is a top tier task. And a fantastic episode too.
267,xxdz3o_00268,Flashback to Greg admitting on national television to shitting in the bath
268,xxdz3o_00269,"I got some flack last week for being overcritical, but two episodes in, I'm still not getting into the groove of this cast. There's something about the humor this season that feels forced, while some of the tasks seem uninspired (i.e. laminate instructions and then follow them; even Fern straight up called the flour task ""boring""). I love this show, so it doesn't make me feel good to say. John's earnest failure continues to make me laugh, though. It's always relatable to have an underdog on the series, whereas I feel like there's not much suspense because Dara is crushing every task by being very rational and single-minded. It's clear to me from episode 2 that either Dara or Sarah will be the winner and the competition is not even close. But enough of my whinging. Some of my favorite moments include John nearly dropping the laptop, burying his face in the flour while trying to suck out grapes, Dara arrogantly flicking the ceramic cup off the table, Fern's continued ""oh no"" motif, John strategically slowing down the treadmill but still failing (""you absolute wanker"") and his tangent in the studio about buying ducks at a pharmacy. Also, Greg's bathtub playtime: ""Can you use elastic bands to make it look like a submarine?"" I thought the live task was fun. The helicopter one drove me crazy though because ""Which aircraft crashes more"" would have worked perfectly if John completed it with ""than airplanes?"" I know Greg guessed it right anyway, but sometimes it feels like they're going more for the humor than being logical about it."
269,xxdz3o_00270,Two sets of points in the lamination task? Not sure how I feel about that…
270,xxdz3o_00271,I saw dara o briain on a bus in Glasgow recently
271,xxdz3o_00272,What was the prize task category? I missed the announcement and couldn't work it out.
272,xxdz3o_00273,"OK seriously, how did they get an empty airport terminal? Edit: I'm clearly underestimating how far in advance they film these."
273,xxdz3o_00274,Is this first task ever involving a computer?
274,xxdz3o_00275,Didn't realise Dara was a boomer.
275,xxdz3o_00276,A TWIST
276,xxdz3o_00277,Also people not knowing how laminators or word works is outrageous to me
277,xxdz3o_00278,This season is shaping up to be a good one
278,xxdz3o_00279,Brilliant that they're looking for hidden grapes.
279,xxdz3o_00280,Dara No'Brain
280,xxdz3o_00281,Vaseline in the bath?
281,xxdz3o_00282,Wtf Greg
282,xxdz3o_00283,What do you do about socks with a duck pattern? Are they counted as ducks or socks?
283,xxdz3o_00284,Dara used science
284,xxdz3o_00285,Four points to beat Katherine Ryan's record
285,xxdz3o_00286,Dara is this series’ Chris Ramsey
286,xxdz3o_00287,I want the final live task matchup between Paul and Acaster.
287,xxdz3o_00288,Trunky flair when?!
288,xxdz3o_00289,"The moral of the story is if you move your child every once in a while and give them water, you can keep them on the brink of death."
289,xxdz3o_00290,"To be fair to Munya, I've seen deader houseplants come back with a bit of BabyBio and a move to a south-easterly position, his future children might not die."
290,xxdz3o_00291,There really isn’t anyone there for Greg to play with…
291,xxdz3o_00292,I have that exact paper guillotine and I feel very sad for getting as excited about that fact as I did.
292,xxdz3o_00293,"Feel like it should have been the number of signs, so that the first part mattered more Edit: nevermind, scored both bits separately"
293,xxdz3o_00294,Boxhead Alex!
294,xxdz3o_00295,Am I going mad or did the Sicily sign say “Silly” when Munya first came on in the laminator task when he was doing the James Bond intro?
295,xxdz3o_00296,Perfect AND anti-perfect episodes still on.
296,xxdz3o_00297,Kearnsy Montana
297,xxdz3o_00298,I NEED THAT IN SLO MO 😂😂😂
298,xxdz3o_00299,After seeing Munya getting hit it reminded me about Alex. Is it this season where he got hurt or is that an upcoming one?
299,xxdz3o_00300,Has Dara got another triumph or did he just cock it up this time?
300,xxdz3o_00301,This has to be a record for most points. Legendary performance from Dara
301,xxdz3o_00302,Sausage: Long and meaty.
302,xxdz3o_00303,"Little knit pick but the grape and flower task, it says you must wear the Flippers for the entire five minutes of the task. John takes them off prior to the whistle."
303,xxdz3o_00304,Fantastic episode.
304,xxdz3o_00305,Could anyone explain the bathtub submarine joke
305,xxdz3o_00306,Hi hi
306,xxdz3o_00307,"Been a hell of a day, nothing quite like taskmaster to solve every mood"
307,xxdz3o_00308,
308,xxdz3o_00309,"Love this category, I could fill the studio with the tat I refuse to chuck out"
309,xxdz3o_00310,Very coordinated outfits for the studio tonight!
310,xxdz3o_00311,This is a great prize task round lmao
311,xxdz3o_00312,L A M I N A T E
312,xxdz3o_00313,Munya lol.
313,xxdz3o_00314,I've gone fishing for fruit in flour one halloween. It's not nice in the slightest. I feel for John there.
314,xxdz3o_00315,I’ve recently moved our toothbrushes into a tankard.
315,xxdz3o_00316,Oh my god dara you were so close
316,xxdz3o_00317,That was tragically brilliant from Dara.
317,xxdz3o_00318,Munya is like a cartoon character
318,xxdz3o_00319,Can't sleep. Scary clown in the caravan will eat me.
319,xxdz3o_00320,Is there a duck in the sock?
320,xxdz3o_00321,YES DARA
321,xxdz3o_00322,Dara’s winning this series isn’t he
322,xxdz3o_00323,"Is this a points in an episode record already, even before the live task?"
323,xxdz3o_00324,Love this game
324,xxdz3o_00325,Another great episode. Really loving this line up!
325,xxdz3o_00326,Coming into this series I really couldn’t work out whether John would be a hero or a disaster. But then all I could think about was him introducing “what do I not know what it is” on the Ed gamble and Matthew Crosby radio show which lent me towards the latter. He has not disappointed in any way
326,xxdz3o_00327,
327,xxdz3o_00328,"The only Taskmaster! (except Jeremy, Babben, Atle, Lasse...)"
328,xxdz3o_00329,Sarah's face of mild disgust is exactly the same as mine
329,xxdz3o_00330,I see the editors are at it again
330,xxdz3o_00331,And there's the twist. Could have gotten a lot more than 5 grapes without touching that flour.
331,xxdz3o_00332,John's gone mental
332,xxdz3o_00333,Pain.
333,xxdz3o_00334,They had to cut away quickly because Alex is getting absolutely bottled.
334,xxdz3o_00335,I love the duck sock sorter task
335,xxdz3o_00336,👏👏👏 Greg
336,xxdz3o_00337,It has become very apparent that checking them in on side and rushing to the other is not going to work
337,xxdz3o_00338,Helicopter crash was probably a reference to the Clutha bar tragedy in Glasgow a few years ago.
338,xxdz3o_00339,Did Sarah just put her hands behind her back when she heard the whistle to prove she wasn't cheating
339,xxdz3o_00340,
340,xxdz3o_00341,"Hahahaha, bastards"
341,xxdz3o_00342,Found the grapes I reckon
342,xxdz3o_00343,HOW?
343,xxdz3o_00344,
344,xxdz3o_00345,
345,xxdz3o_00346,
346,xxdz3o_00347,Fern has a boyfriend NIGHTMARE but what about my season crush
347,xxdz3o_00348,Laughed so much! I am loving the cast so much. I was kind of annoyed with Fern by the end. She called Alex's tasks boring which I feel is a little rude. And then she seemed like she was getting the live task wrong on purpose because she didn't care enough to try. But the other four are hilarious and so fun spirited.
348,xxdz3o_00349,
349,xxdz3o_00350,
0,y37lck_00001,This episode gave me TMNZ 2 vibes all round.
0,y97ib3_00001,Great songs. I love that angry noise Fern made when she read that she had to tidy up as well.
1,y97ib3_00002,I really dislike when the episode is designed to have one person win. Thats why they do all the tasks first then put them in order to suit their episode design.
2,y97ib3_00003,"oh my god I've only just gotten to Fern's podcast episode, and did anyone else here at the time remark in one of the earlier episodes how Fern pissed off Alex by saying the tasks were boring? because I definitely did, which makes me wonder if the redditor she's referring to is me. which makes me feel awful, because I was very much joking when I said that"
3,y97ib3_00004,"Greg just absolutely calling out Sarah's rubbish ex was as heartwarming as Munya's immediate return-diss on Greg was hilarious. Also, simply love how full of joy and charm Sarah is throughout this show. Simply fabulous. I was expecting to resonate with Fern too given, well, autistic Scottish lady vibes, but not quite as much as I have! They're honestly all brilliant this series, and I can't wait to watch more."
4,y97ib3_00005,What was the meaning behind the snake? Was it just a red herring to slow them down?
5,y97ib3_00006,"Has “me Fern Brady, me Fern Brady” been in repeat in anyone’s else’s head since they watched this episode?"
6,y97ib3_00007,Yeah fuck you ex partner!
7,y97ib3_00008,"Genuinely felt for Sarah after that singing task, bless her heart. Could tell she was actually emotional about it."
8,y97ib3_00009,“I’ve brought in a maze.” “Have you brought in a maze?” “I haven’t brought in a maze.”
9,y97ib3_00010,"I love Fern aggresively roaring ""WHHHHAAAT?! at every new task she reads like she had not been told prior to coming on Taskmaster that she needed to actually do work."
10,y97ib3_00011,'You stood still for 80 seconds' lmao
11,y97ib3_00012,“Wait so John beat me?” LOOOOL
12,y97ib3_00013,Petition for a Smooth Rupert flair
13,y97ib3_00014,Dara: ‘I wasn’t aware that we were allowed to write a DISS track.’ Someone hasn’t watched TMNZ series 2.
14,y97ib3_00015,Wait - so John would have won the bubble machine task if he hadn’t insisted for 5 minutes that the machine was already on?! 😂
15,y97ib3_00016,Naughty Satsuma absolutely sounds like something the Horne Section would write. John Kearns and Alex collaboration WHERE.
16,y97ib3_00017,A final fuck you to Sarah's ex husband
17,y97ib3_00018,Lol I’m guessing that took a lot longer than they were expecting in the studio considering the editing
18,y97ib3_00019,"As someone who's also had an ex-partner tell me I'm bad at singing in a passive aggressive way, Sarah being genuinely touched by Greg's compliments & her winning the task felt like a healing moment. ❤️ Fuck you ex-partner!"
19,y97ib3_00020,Greg is so HARSH to Munya tonight: both Smooth Rupert and his rap were really good!
20,y97ib3_00021,"""Some people just seem more alone than others."" That one cut deep for me. John Kearns continues to be the most relatable one to me there. Something about him haphazardly stuffing a tarpaulin into the rubbish bin (and still failing) just feels familiar, somehow. That, and his ""What is happening?"" when he sees the rubber snake is exactly how I would have responded in that situation. I guess it was never really explained why that snake was there, other than getting some candid reaction shots. Lots of fun Munya quotes this episode. ""How do you make it go all stiff?"" ""Practice."" And: ""Last year, when I started learning one new word a day, people laughed at me. Now who's laughing? Me, loquaciously."" And then of course panicking at the last minute and putting down ""sex."" Classical music lyrics was probably my favorite task of the season so far. Especially seeing the ashamed looks on everyone's faces when it cuts back to them in the studio. Poor Sarah was really struggling there and I could recognize that secondhand embarrassment. Greg can be a really good dude at times and raise morale when it's needed. Although for me, John definitely should have taken it with ""I - found a naugh-ty sat-su-ma in my fan-tas-tic cur-ry."" Somehow it just sticks in your head."
21,y97ib3_00022,I WILL HUNT DOWN THE MAN WHO WAS MEAN TO SARAH MILLICAN
22,y97ib3_00023,I’m so confused about the snake… was it just misdirection? I feel like the scoring for the task was handled poorly… the part about tidying up got completely ignored
23,y97ib3_00024,Why would you not go spoon first. Millican the only one with any sense.
24,y97ib3_00025,Dara's wife's watched Taskmaster before
25,y97ib3_00026,"Damn, Fern did well! She even used one of the words as a rhyme!"
26,y97ib3_00027,Mefernbradymefernbrady
27,y97ib3_00028,"Is Alex doing strange things in each episode? When entering the bubble he referred to it uniquely for each contestant, and then when “killing” the snake he had a unique implement for each contestant. Will there be some sort of quiz at the end? Seems way too suspicious for there not to be, given that they don’t really even need to be included in the edit."
28,y97ib3_00029,"I fell in love with Greg a little more today. The way he handled Sarah's story about singing, and her resulting score, was incredibly sweet."
29,y97ib3_00030,"John is the first contestant to make me sad and it's too intense for a telly comedy evening, it's like watching a Soviet kids cartoon from the '70s about a freezing squirrel with no friends in the forest"
30,y97ib3_00031,"Can we just circle back to Fern choosing the suitcase for the folding tarpaulin task, and her first thought is, how do murderers fit bodies in these things?!"
31,y97ib3_00032,"Not gonna lie, Fern doing a happy little jig in a dressing gown as the bubble machine lit up was the cutest shit I've seen all day."
32,y97ib3_00033,I think Sarah was the most genuine emotion we've ever seen in the studio?? She seemed traumatized.
33,y97ib3_00034,"Greg is very Shrewsbury, he hates rap and only eats roasts."
34,y97ib3_00035,‘Fuck your ex partner’ something we can all understand
35,y97ib3_00036,'We've still got breadbin boy to come' 😂😂😂😂😂
36,y97ib3_00037,Defenestration of Prague reference. GCSE history flashbacks.
37,y97ib3_00038,"Dara saying ""Am I being retired"". The day before the last ever Mock the Week airs."
38,y97ib3_00039,I loved Ferns classical song so much. Great use of all her words and they contrasted perfectly with the last line- “I’ll step on their toes!” That was the winner for me
39,y97ib3_00040,John is so endearingly shite
40,y97ib3_00041,I also want the pens that hook together.
41,y97ib3_00042,I found Sarah’s song really comforting and she seemed traumatised when she was talking about her ex partner. It was surprisingly emotional
42,y97ib3_00043,"I cannot believe Johns' weak-shit prize got three points. Munya defended Smooth Rupert to hell and back, it was a cute ornament! John just presented a sad evergreen."
43,y97ib3_00044,"Of all the things I expected from this task, empowerment wasn't one."
44,y97ib3_00045,"Oh yeah, freestyle comedy middle class rapping, that's how Munya became famous."
45,y97ib3_00046,My subtitles just had Greg saying “I’m not STRAIGHT enough to appreciate rap”
46,y97ib3_00047,"I think this episode is the one where I disagree with Greg’s marking the most throughout. Madness. Pizza oven = easily the best prize. Fern should have been disqualified for not tidying the spoons, etc. Come on, Sarah’s song was not the best (but also not as bad as she thought it was!). Let’s see if Ed is of a similar opinion on the podcast."
47,y97ib3_00048,Debajo de la mesa
48,y97ib3_00049,Obsequious Dara had me rolling with his girly “thanks Greg” 😆😂🤣
49,y97ib3_00050,"I don’t think they would have screened the tarpaulin in a container task were it not for Munya DECIDING THAT MASSIVE SHEET WOULD FIT IN A BREAD BIN. I howled. And the sewer underneath is genius, that man’s brain is something else."
50,y97ib3_00051,"I wouldn't give her the five points for the song (I like Munya's better orz) but I relate to Sarah so much because an ex-partner once told me ""Are you singing the backing vocals?"" (because I'm out of tune I guess!!!) while I was singing one time and never got over that comment since (I still love singing but yehhhh). Love you Sarah! And fuck you ex-partners!!"
51,y97ib3_00052,Smooth Rupert for Prime Minister
52,y97ib3_00053,Oh Sarah made me tear up!!
53,y97ib3_00054,"Nobody did badly on the song task. I genuinely think there's a case for equal points all round, or at least 3,4 and 5s all round."
54,y97ib3_00055,"There really is something wild about a woman with an already pretty heavy accent singing ""ME FERN BRADY"" in a German accent while dissing the other contestants."
55,y97ib3_00056,"""Bloody ducks again"" 😂"
56,y97ib3_00057,"Some of the worst scoring ever from Greg, this week. Great episode, though. Bless Sarah. She didn't deserve 5 points on merit for her song, I can see why Greg gave her max points but he got swayed by the spiel that came along with it."
57,y97ib3_00058,John Kearn is quickly turning into my favourite contestant through shear incompetence
58,y97ib3_00059,Absolutely SLAYED them at the end of that beautiful song.
59,y97ib3_00060,Love that from Fern
60,y97ib3_00061,The singing task might be the most difficult to judge of all time. There were four very good performances and one good one
61,y97ib3_00062,"Idk why I come to these discussion threads lol. I always think it's going to be laughing about the goofs and gaffs of the episode but nope, it's just people overanalyzing and being upset about the scores. Every time. Edit: I actually just noticed the default is sorted by new. Sorted by top and its much better actually."
62,y97ib3_00063,"I thought Munya’s rap was a bit anemic, but Smooth Rupert deserved better. I have to say, though, that when John’s song was playing, with the inexplicable lapses into falsetto and SAT [long pause] suma, and with his demeanor straight out of a pietà, I genuinely wondered if I was having a psychotic break."
63,y97ib3_00064,"Feel like this is going to end in the phrase ""It took John nineteen minutes... to spot the car."""
64,y97ib3_00065,I don't mean to sound like Sarah's ex-husband (because fuck that guy) but her song was definitely the worst? Poor Munya
65,y97ib3_00066,I SAID I SAID BEFORE THE TASK I HOPE ONE OF THEM PICKED THE BEST WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEFENESTRATION! DARA IS NOW THE GREATEST CONTESTANT OF ALL TIME
66,y97ib3_00067,You bubbly fuck
67,y97ib3_00068,Crumbs in my bralette. Everything sounds classy set the the backdrop of classical music ❤️
68,y97ib3_00069,Oh Sarah :(
69,y97ib3_00070,That was actually really sweet by Sarah :)
70,y97ib3_00071,Anyone have Sarah's ex's name and address we just wanna talk
71,y97ib3_00072,poor John getting dunked on even when he's not involved
72,y97ib3_00073,I've never disagreed more with a prize task scoring. Munya got robbed on his rap. What I really appreciated about Munya's was that every one else just sang the melody that was already there but Munya actually added to the piece in a more creative way. I really thought he'd be rewarded for it.
73,y97ib3_00074,"I love this series because it feels like 2 parents (Sara and Dara) are taking their 3 kids (Munya, Fern and John) on a holiday and every episode are the wacky antics they get up to."
74,y97ib3_00075,"If Fern is lurking, I just want to say ""hello, and I hope you have a lovely day"""
75,y97ib3_00076,Smooth Rupert is at least a 4 pointer imo. And who doesn’t want a pizza oven?
76,y97ib3_00077,John switched the bubble machine on. He completed the task within a couple seconds. It didn't say it had to be *working.* It said it had to be *on.*
77,y97ib3_00078,Another bit of lore for the fanfic. Thanks Munya
78,y97ib3_00079,That rap was an easy 5 points and it's disgusting that Munya didn't get 5 points
79,y97ib3_00080,"See John, you can win the prize task with a book! :-)"
80,y97ib3_00081,I need the five minutes of Alex and John's bubble machine argument more than is probably healthy
81,y97ib3_00082,did they call the protruding bit of stage the “knappett” in honor of Jessica’s infamous fall or is this a misheard term I’m not familiar with?
82,y97ib3_00083,I’ve never disagreed with the scoring in a task more than that last one. Munya and Dara were clearly the best.
83,y97ib3_00084,Munya talking about ninja turtles in the bread bin sewer was a highlight for me for sure haha
84,y97ib3_00085,this seems to be an unpopular opinion in this sub but I love song tasks and this one was no different. I really enjoyed this episode and it continued to cement Fern as my favorite this series.
85,y97ib3_00086,"No way Fern deserved three points from that one, everyone else made the effort to tidy up. Lucky lucky."
86,y97ib3_00087,God my heart when Sarah talked about singing. I legit started crying in front of the tv like a bloody idiot. Ugh ❤️
87,y97ib3_00088,John is not built for timed tasks
88,y97ib3_00089,Should be a straight DQ if there’s any mess left!! >:(
89,y97ib3_00090,Fern sending all the other contestants to the burn ward.
90,y97ib3_00091,"Defenestration is a great word, Dara is right."
91,y97ib3_00092,"Looks like we’re not getting a Sarah Sweep. She’ll still win, but no sweep."
92,y97ib3_00093,"Fun episode. I hate song tasks usually but these were all REALLY good. I thought about what I would do and it'd be a fackin' shambles, heh. Everyone would be in tears from my voice. Suitcase and tarp task was very meh, especially on the marking. That weapon and snake is definitely going to be a Task later in the series"
93,y97ib3_00094,The walkway being called the knappett had me in stitches
94,y97ib3_00095,Disappointed that no one made a Magnum Opus joke about the complete works of Shakespeare.
95,y97ib3_00096,"I usually don't care about scoring, but Greg really effed the scoring on the song task. He gave 5 to Sarah, 4 to Fern and John, and 2 to Munya and Dara. I agree on not giving anybody 1 point, but I don't think he should have given anybody 2 points either. I have Fern and Munya with 5, John with 4, Sarah and Dara with 3. Sorry, just not as besotted with Sarah's song as Greg was, and Munya's was far better than Greg thought."
96,y97ib3_00097,"Munya deserved better. He is the new underdog with the lowest points scored this episode. Greg is not appreciating his brand of humor in the prize tasks, is he."
97,y97ib3_00098,"Really feel like Sara got some pity points here. I get it was a subjective task but come on lol. Munya got a raw deal as well throughout the episode, but that's just Greg's classic ageism. Fern and John were hilarious as ever. I just love this cast so much."
98,y97ib3_00099,Everyone was surprised that Munya took longer than John.
99,y97ib3_00100,So… what’s the snake to do with it?
100,y97ib3_00101,"The song task points felt entirely backwards to me. The fact that Munya’s literally made a career out of doing rap parody songs and scored the lowest is weird. I reckon my scoring would be Sarah with 2, John with 3, Fern and Munya tied with 4, and I really enjoyed Dara’s so I’d give him five points."
101,y97ib3_00102,"Maybe it was just that yesterday was a crazy day in the UK and by 9pm I was ready for some whimsicality, but I thought that was a very strong episode. I always like song or film based tasks and who doesn't love a reference to the Defenestration of Prague."
102,y97ib3_00103,"After the balloons, I just wanted to hug John and tell him everything would be okay <3"
103,y97ib3_00104,"I think Fern should have gotten the 5 points for the song, but completely understand why Sarah was given it. Once again, a great episode. Really wanting Munya to do better, but he seems to just be bad at tasks."
104,y97ib3_00105,Very dissapointing Greg doesn't know about the Defenestration of Prague.
105,y97ib3_00106,Fern was robbed
106,y97ib3_00107,"Tidying up task was bizarre and underwhelming. Prize task was fine. I liked how the live task was a new spin on a classic. Music task was solid, I would've maybe swapped Fern and Sarah for scoring but can't blame Greg for riding with the emotions (especially with Sarah's backstory). Bubble machine task was a classic though, really helped save the episode. You had hints that everyone missed, Munya overcomplicating it, and classic John incompetence. Lovely. Can you imagine if Sarah won the final task and we got two perfect episodes in the span of 3 episodes? Would've been chaos. Wondering if Fern or Munya will have some big days to sneak into contention or if the trophy race will stay firmly between Dara and Sarah."
107,y97ib3_00108,Can I just say I’m loving the theme in Munya’s prize tasks - Young Pablo & Smooth Rupert 🤩
108,y97ib3_00109,“Bread bin boy” is definitely the sequel to picnic girl
109,y97ib3_00110,"What is bugging me is that we all saw the licence plate on the car that said ""L00K 6OWN"" That, to me, says: ""Look Gown"" (as in the dressing gown) not ""Look Down""."
110,y97ib3_00111,In the podcast fern mentioned that John recently became a father if I heard it right. That could explain his performance
111,y97ib3_00112,Hi Fern!
112,y97ib3_00113,"Well, people wanted to see the diss track task in Taskmaster UK…"
113,y97ib3_00114,Quality live task.
114,y97ib3_00115,I do hope the Knappet is entirely wipedownable.
115,y97ib3_00116,"Can’t believe that Fern just diss her fellow contestants. By the law of rap if they don’t all make a diss track about her, then they will all look weak."
116,y97ib3_00117,"Might not be able to watch this episode, lads, have to get on Google and find out where Munya bought his ""Dogs Drawn as Regency Portraits"" shirt."
117,y97ib3_00118,Surely the RC remote has batteries in it?
118,y97ib3_00119,Can't believe John actually thought about stuff being inside each one. ACTUAL LOGIC
119,y97ib3_00120,A... sewer.
120,y97ib3_00121,"Oh yeah, spoon first makes more sense!"
121,y97ib3_00122,"I was stumped when Fern picked “serendipitous” — that was my first word to go with! Although, “Defenestration” is one of the best words I know, hands down."
122,y97ib3_00123,I am getting worse and worse at predicting how Greg will award points for the prize task.
123,y97ib3_00124,There’s something truly poetic while watching Munya and John desperately shove tarps into their container. Like the last bit of sanity being ripped away from them
124,y97ib3_00125,Does anyone know the point of the snake in the tarpaulin task?
125,y97ib3_00126,Every song should have earned five points
126,y97ib3_00127,"Wonderful episode. John Kearns was a surprisingly adept singer, too! Really loving this series, and especially loving the cast as a whole."
127,y97ib3_00128,Even the minifigure of John looks sad.
128,y97ib3_00129,"Dang Fern, drag em all"
129,y97ib3_00130,Id die for smooth rupert
130,y97ib3_00131,I identify with Fern hating tidying.
131,y97ib3_00132,Fern getting three points for making more mess than there was to start with? I get the feeling explanations got edited out there.
132,y97ib3_00133,"""Write a song"" Dara immediately dies inside."
133,y97ib3_00134,Satsuma Curry was very moving
134,y97ib3_00135,Some sexy new editions to the Alex/Greg lore tonight
135,y97ib3_00136,I generally don’t like it when Greg ties people on subjective tasks but I would have had to give everyone five points for the song task. I shudder to think what I would have done.
136,y97ib3_00137,Fern loves Mozart! Fern loves Mozart!
137,y97ib3_00138,I really wish the younger three are grouped instead after seeing their methods in the tarp task; I'd want to see how they'll do stuff together in a group task. Imagine the chaos while Dara and Sarah are just chilling lmao
138,y97ib3_00139,"John kearnes is making me laugh out loud more than any contestant in recent memory. Ive never seen any of his comedy, is he good?"
139,y97ib3_00140,"Thoughts on the tarpaulin task? I mean, it was hilarious obviously but I reckon there should have been a few zero points but can’t remember the exact wording of the task… can anyone clarify? Got real Roisin vibes from Fern during it with the “already tired” quote two minutes in and just leaving all the mess on the ground. Similar energy levels to Roisin melting the ice block"
140,y97ib3_00141,I just thought it was funny when Alex bonked that snake on the head
141,y97ib3_00142,Anyone else had Fern’s song stuck in their head all week?
142,y97ib3_00143,"I struggle to see how dafty John could fuck this up, but I’m sure as shit he will"
143,y97ib3_00144,Not Sarah looking under the table! We love a consistent queen
144,y97ib3_00145,I kind of feel like a satsuma in a curry might be quite tasty
145,y97ib3_00146,Man I love Dara. Dara for PM
146,y97ib3_00147,"Sarah was so close to the clean sweep but glad she won, I think Munya deserved 5 points for Smooth Rupert and a tied 5 points for the rap tho"
147,y97ib3_00148,"Huh my rankings for the songs would have been very different than Greg’s. I really enjoyed Munya and Dara’s songs (particularly Munya’s) . Sarah’s was actually my least favorite, though I enjoyed it as well. And John’s cracked me up - definite winner for me. Gotta go back and listen to Fern’s again, since I didn’t get most of the lyrics the first time. Solid effort all round imo! :D"
148,y97ib3_00149,Dara's reaction to the tarp task was so legit and relatable for the audience cause it was one of those mindfuck ones where it's simple and straightforward but so many aren't so you psych yourself out
0,yf0zbz_00001,What did John bring in for the prize task? I have no idea what that streaker is…action figure?
1,yf0zbz_00002,"Just a collection of thoughts on the series so far as well as the episode. John's 'I Die Every Week' is one of those jokes that I don't think would have been nearly as hilarious coming from anyone else. Dara is like that contestant that seems always on the verge of fucking up and breaking down, but breaking that pattern somehow also kills at almost every task given. Manwa has been growing on me. I think this has been the only season since the first couple I loved every contestant. Even seven, which is still my favorite series overall, I didn't really like Wang at all. While funny, I really hope Sabatoge doesn't become a regular thing on this show. It worked great as this little one off, but I hope it doesn't get beaten into the ground. Dara's Interview on the Youtube Channel had me laughing more than any other. Really he's just overall my favorite contestant this series. He got robbed on the music round. That write a song round was nothing but really good songs, even taking out Sarah's story behind singing it was still a good song. Were I too rank them myself and not taking the story into account - 2 Points Sarah (Taking her story into account I would still give her the 5) and John, three Manwa, four Dara, Five to our rightful Queen. Really enjoying this series so far, much more than the last couple."
2,yf0zbz_00003,Still laughing at “veeeeeeeee!”
3,yf0zbz_00004,"""Campatative dad"" sounds so much like Greg's awful Chris Eubank impression lol"
4,yf0zbz_00005,"Half way through the series and honestly its been a blast so far. I didn't think much of the cast when it was announced, largely because I didn't know 3/5 well at all but I am pleasantly surprised. They all just seem to be having a fantastic time and the tasks (especially the studio ones!) have been great. I thought John was a shoe-in for being the lowest scoring contestant but he seems to be doing fairly well at this point."
5,yf0zbz_00006,
6,yf0zbz_00007,"Okay, I've given it a fair crack of five episodes and I've gotta say: I'm not feeling this series. Dara and Sarah are solidly entertaining but I'm never super excited to see what they do on a task. Fern, I expected to be much more aggressive, but most of the time she's just sat there or been pretty ordinary. Munya, despite being touted on the podcast as the Weirdest Person Ever, also isn't really giving me much, and John seems to be the designated punching bag simply because Greg has decreed it so. That amounts to three ordinary and two pretty good contestants, which ends with me not being particularly enthused to even watch through a whole episode. I hope I'm wrong going forward - that they gel more in studio and actually have banter - because right now it's nearing the bottom of the pack as far as series go for me."
7,yf0zbz_00008,Dara’s face when Fern suggested John do the miming lol
8,yf0zbz_00009,"I loved Ferns ""I did it again, I got too excited"" line about why she's always tired for the tasks!"
9,yf0zbz_00010,"""so you're learning?"" ""Fuck off!"""
10,yf0zbz_00011,"""I'll hit you later on when you're making a cup of tea. I'm not an idiot."" Sarah being both smart and terrifying"
11,yf0zbz_00012,john pleading with his team screaming “b” is a highlight of this series
12,yf0zbz_00013,"I like that Fern got Dara writing ""Cat"" correct and look forward to the upcoming Greg and Fern tour."
13,yf0zbz_00014,John’s face when munya jumped on him lmao
14,yf0zbz_00015,"""who did that shit drawing?"" ""That was you"""
15,yf0zbz_00016,B! 🐊
16,yf0zbz_00017,If Sally had this task it wouldn't be suitable to air
17,yf0zbz_00018,The live tasks this season are absolutely iconic
18,yf0zbz_00019,It looked like John would be a Kumar but actually he's a Watson: placing pretty well overall but remembered for being kinda shit and getting picked on.
19,yf0zbz_00020,“You’ve been known to do it” hahahaha oh John
20,yf0zbz_00021,CAMPATATAV DAD
21,yf0zbz_00022,"Someone here, who was in the studio audience, said before this series aired that ""you all are not ready for John Kearns"" and now I truly understand what they meant. One of the funniest episodes I've seen in a while and the best so far in this series."
22,yf0zbz_00023,"John's ""I die every week"" is so true. Half way through the episode and it already hurts to laugh"
23,yf0zbz_00024,L 🦘 L 🦘 L 🦘
24,yf0zbz_00025,The sadism with which Fern and Sarah tortured Alex really makes me think this was towards the end of the filming.
25,yf0zbz_00026,Greg's inner eubank impression came through
26,yf0zbz_00027,Oh my god Dara's look of sheer incredulity when John was doing the Crocodile absolutely slayed me
27,yf0zbz_00028,"Alternate episode titles: ""Two very physical men."" ""Give it to the man."" ""I die every week."" ""The gentlest of touches."" ""The Noel Edmonds Zone."""
28,yf0zbz_00029,Munya's talking about Zimbabwe in the ad breaks now.
29,yf0zbz_00030,The sheer befuddlement when either clue giver has to double check the alphabet is marvellous!
30,yf0zbz_00031,"Who would win in the battle of Alex nicknames, Alice Levine with ""Hello my little ferret"" or Munya Chawawa with ""What are you doing down there you spicy turnip?"
31,yf0zbz_00032,"imagine Fern, Bridget Christie and Rhod Gilbert all being a TM team and they were given the ""have the most pleasure"" task. Alex would never make it out alive"
32,yf0zbz_00033,That photo of John was incredible.
33,yf0zbz_00034,"Fern’s cat leash would have received 5 points from me, because it’s the sort of thing you think/hope will be useful, shell out (too much) $$ for, and then are bitterly disappointed by how useless it is"
34,yf0zbz_00035,"“Are you having pleasure?” “Oh, I can see a little green fly!” Sounds like a yes to me."
35,yf0zbz_00036,"""Do you like bananas?"" ""Yes."" ""CATCH THEM IN YOUR MOUTH."""
36,yf0zbz_00037,The Reverse Wilkinson!
37,yf0zbz_00038,Munya has what I can only describe as a Katherine Parkinson level of understanding of elastic bands
38,yf0zbz_00039,who know munya and sarah would be such a fucking good comedy duo
39,yf0zbz_00040,"At the half-point mark, John is higher than Munya for the series score. There's an analysis to ben done on the power of confidence and first impressions. Even though both John and Munya have been mostly mediocre on the tasks results, we still think Munya is better. John subdued and unassuming posture makes us automatically underestimate him, so we find bias validation when he fails badly. Munya is making us certain he's gonna ace it all, finds excuses when he doesn't, and we forgive him for it and we remember the bravado and confidence, the swagger the ease the comfort. What bad results I don't remember any failures... I will be paying close attention to that when I rewatch this series."
40,yf0zbz_00041,I cannot believe John has won multiple episodes 😂
41,yf0zbz_00042,no john patatas has been through a lot don’t swing him around like that
42,yf0zbz_00043,"""HE YELLS IN DISPLEASURE"" ""HE GRUNTS IN DISPLEASURE"" I love whoever did the subtitles lol"
43,yf0zbz_00044,They've knocked it out the park this series with live tasks.
44,yf0zbz_00045,Alex getting called out non-stop by Fern about the passive-aggressiveness is hilarious
45,yf0zbz_00046,“I die every week”. ☠️ Kearns is fast becoming one of my favourite Taskmaster contestants.
46,yf0zbz_00047,Why does chucking trolleys about look like so much fun
47,yf0zbz_00048,"Two unconnected thoughts: John's crocodile mime had shades of S10 Hippogate--I thought John's mime was really good and was frustrated it took them so long to get it. Scalpel, Please! is one of my favorite things to ever happen on this show. I did not expect great things from Fern's lovely choreographic drawing but it was brilliant."
48,yf0zbz_00049,i love how much munya wants to include the greg statue in so many of his tasks
49,yf0zbz_00050,"""I'm trying my best!"" Aren't we all John, aren't we all"
50,yf0zbz_00051,Alex is probably happy he didn't think of this task for when Rhod was on
51,yf0zbz_00052,That was an all time great live task.
52,yf0zbz_00053,Munya must be the most underscored contestant ever. Greg keeps putting him lower than he deserves.
53,yf0zbz_00054,INAUDIBLE BUT SOON TO BE REVEALED DISCUSSION
54,yf0zbz_00055,V! 🐺 V! 🐺
55,yf0zbz_00056,"When Fern was torturing Alex in the tubes, was anyone else on the edge of their seats waiting for Alex to topple over and smash his eye socket on the driveway?"
56,yf0zbz_00057,Wait - is Munya from Zimbabwe?
57,yf0zbz_00058,John has won twice as many episodes as Dara but has approximately 30% fewer points. He’s either first or he’s last.
58,yf0zbz_00059,"""He yells in displeasure"" Even the subtitles on All4 are betraying John!"
59,yf0zbz_00060,Another great live task. Munya getting the wrong letter was probably the highlight.
60,yf0zbz_00061,"Munya immortalised the ""LeBron James"" meme kid, and now he's immortalising the DX crotch chop. God bless this man"
61,yf0zbz_00062,I feel like Dara was robbed only getting 2 points in the happiness task.
62,yf0zbz_00063,John sadly saying “I’m trying my best” while Alex throws a football at his head over and over is perfection
63,yf0zbz_00064,"Absolutely love that all the men saw the tubes and thought ""sports. i will chuck a ball through that."" and the women thought ""torture. i will restrict Alex's movement/senses and throw food at him."""
64,yf0zbz_00065,John's looked like a claustrophobic nightmare
65,yf0zbz_00066,“Doing something well” John is absolutely brilliant
66,yf0zbz_00067,That's gotta be up there with one of the best live tasks.
67,yf0zbz_00068,"Surely the title should have been ""i die every week"""
68,yf0zbz_00069,Who else find Munya incredibly handsome? And charming? Because hot damn!
69,yf0zbz_00070,MUNYA GOT THREE POINTS WHEN IT DIDNT COST TWENTY POUNDS?! ED IS GUNNA BE LIVID
70,yf0zbz_00071,Fern's joy is so infectious
71,yf0zbz_00072,Cracking Chimp impression.
72,yf0zbz_00073,How has John won 2 eps before Dara. Dara getting to 100 points at least as fast as Liza. Might be the fastest? I think in any other season Sarah would be a real contender for winning. She is just unfortunate to have been put in same series as Dara who could be one of the most consistent contestant very rarely doesn't get at least 3 points. The way John moves looks like he has some real back issues.
73,yf0zbz_00074,"The more I see of Munya, the more charming he seems. Munya Chawarming. Congrats to John on the episode win! Absolutely loved the Reverse Wilkinson."
74,yf0zbz_00075,Bravo subtitler bravo. Task: have the most pleasure with these rubber chutes Subtitles for johns attempt: groans in displeasure.
75,yf0zbz_00076,"I've never seen a contestant owning being the butt of the joke in a series as much as John, hats off to him"
76,yf0zbz_00077,PATATAS LIVES
77,yf0zbz_00078,Subtitles as John started crawling through his tunnel: “John yells in displeasure”
78,yf0zbz_00079,i live in fear of how dara will cope with another team task
79,yf0zbz_00080,"You can really see the differences in the teams there. One’s enjoying themselves, the other’s got John on it."
80,yf0zbz_00081,This looks like the most amount of fun I've ever seen on this show. And that is saying something.
81,yf0zbz_00082,Holy shit John actually found something he’s good at.
82,yf0zbz_00083,"The fact that john is not in last place, fucking astonishing"
83,yf0zbz_00084,To think I was worried John wouldn't win anything and he's won 40% of the series episodes so far 😅
84,yf0zbz_00085,"Surprised they didn't call this episode ""Competitive Dad."" John Kearns continues to be the most relatable one on this series. Sometimes he gets lucky and smashes the trolley game, and other times he howls like a V. Amazingly, he's still managed to win two episodes and he's no longer in last place! I also appreciated Greg's observation: ""I think John just expresses pleasure in a different way."" Some funny bits -- ""Give it to the man"" and ""What's my catchphrase?"" ""Happy Birthday."" I loved Fern cracking up when John kept fucking up the letters. I kept repeating that last section of the animal game for all of her reactions."
85,yf0zbz_00086,“you see you’re learning aren’t you” 💀 fuck
86,yf0zbz_00087,Dara looking concerned with John
87,yf0zbz_00088,"I don't normally like bonus points, but Fern psychically discerning that Dara wrote ""cat"" deserved some mention at least lol"
88,yf0zbz_00089,Can someone unbritish what john brought? I only understood the word streaker
89,yf0zbz_00090,I DIE EVERY WEEK 😂
90,yf0zbz_00091,"Here on the continent, we do indeed build our luggage areas for speed"
91,yf0zbz_00092,"Bad Wolf was trending on Twitter after the show, but it wasn’t for what I thought it was…"
92,yf0zbz_00093,Veeee veeeee veeeeee veeeeeeeeeeee
93,yf0zbz_00094,I think I have a crush on Fern and her chaotic energy
94,yf0zbz_00095,One of my personal favourite moments was the photos of them experiencing “pleasure”
95,yf0zbz_00096,"He had to make a Harry Potter tent. - Hah, dear me, should we pretend it cost 21 pounds? (I like when Greg makes a little performance to justify being soft). Fern excited to see the little green fly - an endearing relatable moment before she turned to tormenting Alex. John, what's you definition of pleasure? - Doing something well. 👏 John looked surprisingly like a koala hugging that pillar, and also surprisingly held when Munya jumped on him without a warning."
96,yf0zbz_00097,"“I’ll hit you later on, when you’re having a cup of tea” has to be the greatest line of the episode so far."
97,yf0zbz_00098,"And with that, John has won twice as many episodes as Dara."
98,yf0zbz_00099,"This has been one of the best series IMO. Also, I mean this in a good way, but Fern has a very dorky laugh, she kinda sounds like one of those animatronic clowns used in carnival games/mini golf obstacles. Which might just be a US thing I'm not sure. But anyway it is a very nice laugh."
99,yf0zbz_00100,"Ah the classic humiliate Alex task, just what we all wanted"
100,yf0zbz_00101,there was a whole skull in there! no wonder he was grunting in displeasure
101,yf0zbz_00102,"""What you can't take away from me is that I had a lovely day."""
102,yf0zbz_00103,VEEEE
103,yf0zbz_00104,We almost found another John strength there. Now he just appears to be having a nervous breakdown.
104,yf0zbz_00105,John gets his streaker back.
105,yf0zbz_00106,I really need Fern and Munya to win an episode Edit for spelling
106,yf0zbz_00107,Usually not a fan of the live tasks but this one was fantastic. John and Munya really were the perfect choices to act out the animals
107,yf0zbz_00108,"I didn't do a screenshot of this, but in the tube task, my subtitles (I was watching on All 4 with my VPN, so maybe somebody else saw this) had John groaning in displeasure as he was wiggling down the tube, which was the exact opposite of this task."
108,yf0zbz_00109,"It's shocking that John has two episode wins already, less shocking that even with those two wins he's only one point ahead of the last place"
109,yf0zbz_00110,"Greg labelling of Munya is spot on. I was shocked that he was in last place as his confidence is through the roof. Top contestant though. This series has been great so far, the tube task is probably up there with one of my favourites, good on Fern for getting him back for Alex's English passive aggressive comments"
110,yf0zbz_00111,"When Fern said she can tell the words Dara was writing from the hand movements, and then got it correct, so maybe we will be seeing Greg and Fern touring soon?"
111,yf0zbz_00112,"I'm absolutely going to use this final task at parties, it's brilliant!"
112,yf0zbz_00113,Laughed so hard I peed a little at John's at Veeeeeee Veeeee wolf!
113,yf0zbz_00114,"Gatwick is my favourite location since the railway museum, and I think trolley bowls might be the task I'd most like to attempt since sneaking up on Alex."
114,yf0zbz_00115,"Disappointed that no one bothered with the lesser spotted blue tit, the anorexic elephant nor the eight bollocked cat … veeeeeeeeee"
115,yf0zbz_00116,"John's broken little ""I'm tryin' my best"" during the pleasure task sums up his TM experience thus far so perfectly!"
116,yf0zbz_00117,"Oh my god, the subtitles saying ""He yells in displeasure"""
117,yf0zbz_00118,"John is rapidly becoming one of my favourite contestants. Earlier in the series I thought he'd be slated with Nish Kumar, David Baddiel and Paul Chowdhry as being rubbish at Taskmaster. But he's got two episode wins to his name and ISN'T in last. He's a solid contestant."
118,yf0zbz_00119,Alex really needs to stop confiding his worst thoughts in Greg
119,yf0zbz_00120,MASH looks different
120,yf0zbz_00121,"Rhod, James and Phil would win this task. After all, everybody’s got feelings."
121,yf0zbz_00122,YESSSSSSSSSSS JOOOOOOOHN
122,yf0zbz_00123,"They made us suffer with that ""where was John's foot"" question."
123,yf0zbz_00124,"Oh, Alex, you FUCKING TROLL. That was mean."
124,yf0zbz_00125,"There's no middle ground with John, only top or bottom"
125,yf0zbz_00126,do we actually think dara is going to defy the first seat curse?
126,yf0zbz_00127,The luggage cart task looked so fun and something I have definitely thought of doing. I loved how Dara and John were able to curl their carts around some missed carts.
127,yf0zbz_00128,"My god, seeing Fern absolutely losing it at John's wolf impression had me struggling to breathe"
128,yf0zbz_00129,"Honestly that tube task. Had my customary rewatch today and I rewound it several times. John trying and failing, Fern’s glee at torturing Alex. The studio after with Greg saying competitive dad wrong and the pics of John ‘having fun’ It’s the funniest thing I’ve seen in ages."
129,yf0zbz_00130,That live task was one of the most laugh out loud tasks in a long time
130,yf0zbz_00131,"The final task was brilliant. It's IMPOSSIBLE to mime a wolf howling with the vowel ""veeeeeeh"" it's so far away from owowooooooow"
131,yf0zbz_00132,Trolley bowling legit looks like it would be so much fun.
132,yf0zbz_00133,"Dara is totally on course to be the best-performing contestant ever. If you do an episode average of points, Dara blows everyone out of the water with an average of 20.4 points over the 5 episodes thus far (Katherine Ryan averaged 18.8 points over the 5 episodes of her series, and she's actually the highest episode average scorer among all contestants bar Dara). Not to be outdone, Sarah is also par for the course to landing in the upper echelon of Taskmaster greats, with 18 points averaged per episode (putting her just behind Dara, Katherine, Liza, Noel and Jon). Also, it is safe to say that the first chair curse will finally be broken this series? Dara would have to be catastrophically awful in the next five episodes to not win, I reckon."
133,yf0zbz_00134,Is that Patatus? The toy cat from Series 2?
134,yf0zbz_00135,"Not a worm trumpet - that's a pinard for listening to fetal heartbeats In fairness thats quite a nice one, will probably cost £20 (the plastic ones are about £7) does take a while to tune your ear in - but as a midwife, it's really useful (and I do own one)"
135,yf0zbz_00136,The maintenance guys at gatwick must be shitting themselves watching
136,yf0zbz_00137,I love it when Greg laughs and his glasses go up to his forehead
137,yf0zbz_00138,"I think this episode has to be in the running for the best episode ever. All the tasks were amazing, there were embarrassing moments, cheering moments and B B B B B B B B."
138,yf0zbz_00139,This is John's second episode win. I guess Nish is also shit at predicting who has the wiff of a Kumar.
139,yf0zbz_00140,'I die every week '
140,yf0zbz_00141,JOHN DID SOMETHING WELL OMG
141,yf0zbz_00142,Veeeeeee 🐺
142,yf0zbz_00143,Really need CAMPATATAV DA as a flair
143,yf0zbz_00144,I put it to you!!!
144,yf0zbz_00145,Outraged for Dara there. John was clearly in pain the whole time
145,yf0zbz_00146,"I thought Fern had a shot! I'll be quite chuffed if she actually manages to win an episode, but unfortunately I think she self-sabotages too much. (Not deliberately. On Gamble's podcast, she said on the tarp task she got bored, and I can see that in some of the tasks. She's thrilled to be doing this, but I can see how it can be a challenge for her.)"
146,yf0zbz_00147,"Wait, so there was nothing to say they couldn't cross the line in the trolley task, they just had to start behind the line. They could have placed the first trolley at the end of the terminal, come back to get a second trolley from behind the line, started the attempt from behind the line, then pushed it the whole way."
147,yf0zbz_00148,Patatas!
0,yldx2c_00001,Watching John is just so funny. That color task.
1,yldx2c_00002,It’s on YouTube for free
2,yldx2c_00003,Re: the mirroring task. I would have asked Alex for a full length mirror and got him to carry it along at the same speed as me.
3,yldx2c_00004,"OK episode. Travelator task was great, and standup comedians who spend a lot of time timing their acts (especially if they work on TV and need to be able to work to a short slot) are very suited to that... ad writers would also knock it out of the park, they're the other people I know who spend all their time both being creative and constantly timing things to 60 seconds in their heads... The milk task demonstrated clearly how there's a bit of a lack of lateral thinking and risk-taking among the contestants this season since none of them waited particularly long to start the task and only Sarah even attempted to do anything but play the task straight once they opened it. Didn't end up very interesting, it was all decided but who held out the longest after Alex told them he wouldn't open it yet if he were them.... Thought Dara was VERY harshly judged in the paint task. His hand briefly going above his waist to no benefit is different from Sarah constantly having her hands up to steady the paint and the ""not stepping on all the stepping stones"" problems, and the judging so far this season has been forgiving of minor issues like that. Live task was basically decided by the random element of whether they went feet or inches, not very interesting. Nice unicorn from Dara though."
4,yldx2c_00005,"People in the comments are saying they feel bad for Fern because of how she reacted to her airport mirror task performance, but what you have to realize is that she's autistic, so her facial expression can look a bit off to neurotypical people. It took me a while to notice too, but tears were running down her face because she was laughing so hard, not because she was sad. Fern was fine and actually had a blast watching the task - apparently she said as much on Twitter."
5,yldx2c_00006,Loved all the recorded tasks but this live task was one of the weakest of all seasons in my opinion
6,yldx2c_00007,
7,yldx2c_00008,"If a million people did this the travelator task then Sarah would still be on top, maybe joint top, but top."
8,yldx2c_00009,The comedy just finds John he doesn’t even have to try
9,yldx2c_00010,"I have waited literally six months to find out what “Wait, what?” was all about. I watched Ep 8 being taped and someone in the audience who had also been there the previous day shouted, “Wait, what?” at Dara and he literally said, “Ah, now all the rest of you are going to have to wait till the show airs to find out what that’s all about.” It’s been so frustrating!"
10,yldx2c_00011,"""He's not on the crucifix is he?"" Tears."
11,yldx2c_00012,I think what we can establish from this is that Alex is trusted a lot less than Paul williams
12,yldx2c_00013,First name? - John - Starsign? - Kearns and that long pause after captured social awkwardness SO well
13,yldx2c_00014,I’m sorry how are we not impressed at Sarah FUCKING NAILING the timing? How?!?!
14,yldx2c_00015,"Munya sold the Sucker Tron 3000 so well in the studio - got on his feet and reenacted it like he was a Western gunman walking into a saloon, spotting a dusty laptop, and cleaning it up. Fern admitted that the weird panties weren't her first choice - she actually got emailed a voucher to get a tour to a dildo factory."
15,yldx2c_00016,"Heartbroken for Fern during the travelator task. ""I tried really hard... I didn't know it was that bad!"""
16,yldx2c_00017,i had a nice coat on 😂 i love sarah
17,yldx2c_00018,"The smash cut to John, already covered in yellow paint before the task even started, made me laugh out loud so hard."
18,yldx2c_00019,i cant believe sarah stank up the lab with spoiled milk for munya
19,yldx2c_00020,"I love the background music they used for the travellator task for Sarah, it was the same eerie music they used for the mirroring task in the Church with Victoria Coren-Mitchell et al."
20,yldx2c_00021,"""He's not on the crucifix, is he?"" ""Gotta keep my biceps contracted. Like a constipated eagle."" ""It is on the low rung of the regret shelves. It's eye level, it is absolutely eye level."" I enjoyed the mirroring mirroring mirror-ing task, including Fern being completely mortified by her performance and nearly breaking down afterwards. ""I...I tried really hard. I feel like I don't know what's real anymore."" Poor thing! The paint bullseye task was my favorite of the night, which makes it all the more disappointing that everyone was disqualified for basically trying to keep their balance. If nothing else, give them a time penalty for each infraction, since they all completed the objective. Here's my favorite screen grab of the night: Alex hiding his face behind his clipboard as John's helmet camera gets caught in the flags."
21,yldx2c_00022,fern on twitter: “Now when you watch this airport task I need you to bear in mind I came to Taskmaster to win...” BUCKLE UP!!!
22,yldx2c_00023,"Damn Reddit’s gone down at the worst possible time. Anyway a few thoughts in retrospect: Dara was channeling Ardalo trying to get Munya DQ’d in the travelator task. I thought John was going to be the episode’s title with his performance in the paint/target task. It felt like there were too many rules and tricks in that task. Either have the hidden stepping stones, or the big gap, or the lowered hands rule. But all together is a recipe for a disaster as was evidenced by the full disqualification. John is just consistently hilarious, regardless of whether he’s doing well or badly."
23,yldx2c_00024,Munya does every task like there are bonus style points. 😂
24,yldx2c_00025,That's me Fern Brady
25,yldx2c_00026,"How was this episode not titled “Wait, What?”!"
26,yldx2c_00027,John skipping to minimise the reliance on the travelator was pretty wise.
27,yldx2c_00028,"For our American readers: the UK Dennis The Menace isn't the same as the US one, though by coincidence their strips began in the same week."
28,yldx2c_00029,"""SARAH HONKS WITH LAUGHTER"" Thank you whoever does the subtitles, I love you"
29,yldx2c_00030,FYI they had to reshoot the banana thing several times.
30,yldx2c_00031,"Can't believe a Reddit failure interrupted a Taskmaster live-post, doing more damage to future historical research than burning the library of Alexandria."
31,yldx2c_00032,Fern cracking up at how bad her airport run was was the highlight for me. Honestly she’s such a delight. But Dara holding the milk for a nano second was classic too.
32,yldx2c_00033,“Sarah Milkycan” is the most on-the-nose name pun Alex has done in a while.
33,yldx2c_00034,I’d never heard of John before this but I am obsessed with him now
34,yldx2c_00035,"Munya wasn’t penalised for not crossing the line, but Dara gets disqualified for pushing his goggles up with two fingers, whilst being the only one to get every stepping stone - so harsh on Dara! Feels like they’re handicapping him a bit with the scoring decisions."
35,yldx2c_00036,"Alternate episode titles: ""Milky peas."" ""A constipated eagle."" ""Mirroring."" ""I tried really hard."" ""Speed and violence."" ""One jaunty prancer."""
36,yldx2c_00037,Alex’s reaction to John’s favorite singer being Rufus Wainwright!!! 😅😅😅😅
37,yldx2c_00038,Is John the slowest contestant ever? It seems like there’s always a solid two minutes of his brain processing after the start of a task.
38,yldx2c_00039,Those reactions put an end to the idea that any of these have watched TM NZ.
39,yldx2c_00040,"Ferns' detached but genuine bafflement over the structure, wording and general aim of so many of these tasks continues to bring me absolute joy."
40,yldx2c_00041,"Sarah's little ""...whoopsie..."" face as she realised how difficult she had made the cleaners' life was brilliant."
41,yldx2c_00042,Genuinely wept with laughter at John trying to read the task with that horn on his head 😂
42,yldx2c_00043,Bop bop Unicorn hat
43,yldx2c_00044,Link to original microwave task from NZ for anyone who hasn't seen it
44,yldx2c_00045,“They’re up there! But I don’t go there!” Kind of obvious by this point.
45,yldx2c_00046,"Damn, I can barely notice the difference between Sarah’s runs!"
46,yldx2c_00047,WAIT WHAT NO
47,yldx2c_00048,The paint on the bullseye task was Greg's chance to be really strict after being really forgiving lately.
48,yldx2c_00049,"It was so satisfying and hilarious to see Dara so befuddled during the milk task, as he’s usually so on top of things."
49,yldx2c_00050,"Dara's lead has dropped to 3 points. If Sarah keeps going like this, she could easily take the series."
50,yldx2c_00051,"I think it would be better if they left the milk task as it was in NZ. Everyone just got confused and didn't realise what was going on, and Alex asking questions instead of just standing there warning not to open the task didn't help."
51,yldx2c_00052,That smug little grin on Alex. He's fucking loving this.
52,yldx2c_00053,“Got to keep my biceps contracted. Like a constipated eagle”
53,yldx2c_00054,"""Arse"" I love Dara"
54,yldx2c_00055,Hardest I’ve laughed maybe all series was Fern’s reaction to her travelator task.
55,yldx2c_00056,I'm here for John Kearns fuck ups
56,yldx2c_00057,munya chawawa held two chihuahuas
57,yldx2c_00058,TURN THE TRAVELATOR OFF
58,yldx2c_00059,i’m always surprised when john does anything well
59,yldx2c_00060,"Wait, what?"
60,yldx2c_00061,Those unicorn helmets for the live tasks are AMAZING.
61,yldx2c_00062,"Damn Daras worst ep, Sarah is in striking distance now. I think nz did the milk task better, the timer kind of went against the idea, you are hoping someone takes ages else the timer is just working against Alex saying dont open it"
62,yldx2c_00063,FEARNE REALISING THAT SHE BROUGHT THE OPPOSITE THING IN IM DEAD
63,yldx2c_00064,"Alternate episode title: ""Wait, What?"" Loved Sarah's prize task, a well-deserved 5. The rest were okay. I like the NZ milk jug task, the additional wrinkle of a DQ at 0 was almost meaningless but it did confuse Dara, which was the best moment of this adaptation. David really made the original but nobody did that here. Really felt bad for Fern in this one, highlighted by her walks. Sarah was very impressive with her timing, and John and Munya were very stylish. Not sure about the paint task but it is funny to see a 5-DQ task, not a ton of those outside of Series 10. Immediately when Alex said ""feet or inches"" I thought of the Series 12 painting task and thought inches would be the better pick. Didn't expect it to be so directly the same, and inches was definitely a huge advantage. Series is very close now, Dara leads Sarah by just 3 points and Fern is 4 points behind the tied John and Munya for the bottom group. It's so hard to know who to root for because I'd love to see both Dara and Sarah again. I feel like Dara and Ed Gamble would be a funny dynamic since they're both so competitive, not that we'll ever see it (aside from the podcast)."
64,yldx2c_00065,Reddit servers continue to be trash year on year! Fern Brady needs protecting at all costs.
65,yldx2c_00066,OMG baby Sarah and her Philip Schofield obsession
66,yldx2c_00067,"Yes it’s the NZ task! This was one of my absolute favourites from that version. Edit: wait I think they switched it up… Edit2: I misheard the task, it’s lowest time on the clock without being zero. So it’s still the same idea, leave it as long as possible. Just with a limit."
67,yldx2c_00068,Alex's face at Dara fucking up the task. 🤣
68,yldx2c_00069,Also the Munya documentary afterwards is amazing so far.
69,yldx2c_00070,"Wait, what?"
70,yldx2c_00071,"I feel like this might be a rare case where production dropped the ball a little bit on the live task. I can't help but wonder if it would've been better if the ""inches"" people had even shorter rods. It would wind up them arguably having equal difficulty. You can completely see your work with the long brush, but it's hard to control. The total opposite with the short brush edit: and to clarify (I think I saw someone else reference this), the LOOK of everything about the live task, the design of the helmets I agree was absolutely fantastic and lovely. production did most definitely NOT ""drop the ball"" on that. Just that for the task itself, I wonder how it would've went if the shorter ones were even more so"
71,yldx2c_00072,John’s foot brushing the ring rope seemingly forever in the paint bullseye task had me howling.
72,yldx2c_00073,"I like how they added a countdown for the milk task, Alex didn't want to risk the chance of a David just talking for over an hour"
73,yldx2c_00074,for anyone who hasnt seen the new zeeland version. here you go
74,yldx2c_00075,"Munyas mirror task wasn’t even mirrored, he should not have got bonus points"
75,yldx2c_00076,Surely episode title should have been “Wait what?”?!
76,yldx2c_00077,"Munya did not mirror himself, he copied himself!"
77,yldx2c_00078,Alternate episode title: Millican’s Milky Pocket
78,yldx2c_00079,"I felt bad for Fern after the travelator task. She seemed to find it funny, but also genuinely upsetting. I just really want her to have a good episode soon."
79,yldx2c_00080,Munya didn't mirror the airport task. Suitcase was on the same side on both runs.
80,yldx2c_00081,"Bit of a mixed episode in my opinion. Some good tasks, but some wonky scoring. Prize Task: Fun idea. Thought Sarah should've gotten 1, and Dara the 5 though. No clue how Sarah got that many points. Task 1 (proper): Another task originally from TM NZ. Think they over complicated this one in an attempt to make it different. So it felt inferior to the original task imo. Also a display of Alex helping a bit too much. Task 2: Really strong location task, very fitting. I would've preferred the stylish element to be a part of the main task not a bonus though as while Sarah was dead on it was so dull. (also cool use of the 'copy Alex' music from series 12. Task 3: Great task, but crap scoring. If everyone stepped on all the 'stones' than they wouldn't have bothered with the hands below the waist. Dara getting disqualified was ridiculous and really felt like they just don't want Dara winning this series. Live Task: Fun idea, but I'm never a massive fan of the 50/50 choice that will basically decide whether you do well or not (like the series 11 painting task). So yeah, okay episode, but it's really starting to feel like Greg's underscoring Dara and overscoring Sarah. Greg allowing Munya to be over the line, but then disqualifying Dara for his hand above his waist that didn't even help in in the task felt pretty annoying. Just makes me feel like Greg doesn't want Dara winning the series."
81,yldx2c_00082,there is no way this is going to be as good as david correos
82,yldx2c_00083,dara was so confused and annoyed lmaooo
83,yldx2c_00084,The music from the copy Alex task!
84,yldx2c_00085,Reddit runs on TM points it seems. Worst time to go down
85,yldx2c_00086,I love this cast. I don't think I've ever seen Alex break as many times during tasks as he has this season. John getting his foot caught in the rope like a puppy had me crying. Didn't know anything from Munya coming into this but he has become my favorite contestant.
86,yldx2c_00087,Hit the emergency stop on the travelator!
87,yldx2c_00088,"What, wait?! Wait, what!?"
88,yldx2c_00089,i love sarah so so much
89,yldx2c_00090,Greg’s definitely a lot more generous nowadays. Munya would have gotten no points for that once upon a time.
90,yldx2c_00091,"WOW impressed by how close some of these folks were timing-wise, especially Sarah. I totally would have looked like Fern."
91,yldx2c_00092,"Not a fan of tasks where everyone gets disqualified. It just ends up feeling a little pointless, even if the task itself is fun. I’d at least give a pity point to the person who got closest."
92,yldx2c_00093,So the Milk task was first used in Taskmaster New Zealand. I was hoping one of the contestants had seen it and knew what to do.
93,yldx2c_00094,"This is an episode, that as an American, really emphasizes differences between us and England. First off, Dennis the Menace is a completely different character in the US, created by Hank Ketchum, although ironically enough, both characters premiered on the same day in the US and the UK, 12 March 1951 (I can't find it doing a quick search, but I think I saw an interview once in which Matt Goering was disappointed in the live-action series in 1959 and Bart Simpsons was supposed to be a more accurate depiction of what Dennis the Menace was supposed to be than the portrayals in other TV series.). In the mirror task, the one walkway is referred to as a travelator, but in the US it is refered to as a moving sidewalk. (Disney uses a system that's similar that's called an Omnimover that incorporates a constantly moving platform that's integrated with a continuosly moving ride, but I only know this because I'm dragged to Disney World way too often.)"
94,yldx2c_00095,Laughed so hard during Dara's that I think I hurt myself
95,yldx2c_00096,"John may not have won the episode, but he’s definitely won my heart!"
96,yldx2c_00097,Thought old milk peas would get John to talk for 30 minutes straight
97,yldx2c_00098,"And the moral of the story is: Bigger isn't always better. Also: ""Wait, What?"" is totally the alternate episode title."
98,yldx2c_00099,"Not one of them thought to hit the emergency stop on the moving sidewalk! It would have been my first move, even if I had to book to the other end to do it."
99,yldx2c_00100,"Oh John, I love him more every week. The squat made me cackle like a maniac. I wanna be his friend! Rufus Wainwright is one of my all time faves as well, I’m pretty sure I let out a squeal when he said that. I don’t approve of Alex saying yuck, Rufus is absolutely amazing ❤️ Lol Rufus Wainwright being mentioned in an episode of Taskmaster is the last thing I expected but I feel like it made my night!"
100,yldx2c_00101,Another New Zealand task!
101,yldx2c_00102,"Watching David Correos would have benefitted them immensely, you can't say that often"
102,yldx2c_00103,Why has no one emptied the milk bottles as quickly as possible?
103,yldx2c_00104,Dara dismounting the travelator with the exact energy of Mr Blobby at 1:48
104,yldx2c_00105,I love John.
105,yldx2c_00106,Is there anything in the suitcase?
106,yldx2c_00107,Is Fern up there with the least amount of points gotten in a single episode?
107,yldx2c_00108,omg it’s the don’t open the task task from nz
108,yldx2c_00109,Appreciating the 80s perm from tiny Sarah in that picture
109,yldx2c_00110,I love travelators as well. I especially like the ones at Waterloo station
110,yldx2c_00111,Sarah had her hands on her helmet for a lot of that - didn't the task say you couldn't handle it at any point?
111,yldx2c_00112,"Wait, how old is Philip Schofield? Edit: Turns out he is 13 years older than Sarah. Story checks out."
112,yldx2c_00113,"Awww’s from the audience for Schof, can tell this was filmed before queuegate."
113,yldx2c_00114,Does anyone know where Munya got that shirt?
114,yldx2c_00115,"Often I find that there’s a contestant who I’m like “They’ll come last, I’m fine with that coz that’s their “thing”.” But this series, of the three currently contending for bottom ranking, Fern, John and Munya, I really don’t want any of them to come last. John is the obvious contender to come last, but I don’t want him to, coz he’s had his great moments. Munya I think has been quite harshly judged so far, and Fern’s been quite consistent bar this week. It’s been one of my favourite casts."
115,yldx2c_00116,I adore Fern Brady! That mirror walk task was great stuff!
116,yldx2c_00117,"Was there anything in the wording of the paint/stepping stone task about having to keep the helmet on? Could they have taken it off and held it below their waist before starting so as not to spill any and to make it easier getting under the obstacles? I probably would have done that before reading ""your time starts now""."
117,yldx2c_00118,"I didn’t hear the task fully, can you just pour the milk on the floor so it’s light to hold?"
118,yldx2c_00119,That final wait what cracked me up big time. Decent ep apart from that.
119,yldx2c_00120,"What did John say on the podcast? ""they make sure there's an arc to it"" or something? I think they might really have front loaded the series with his worst and he's a real contender. Or is that a silly wish? But given that Greg is now fully in love with him (as we all are right?) so is steadily marking him better and that his ponderous and weird approach oftentimes pays up and we're starting to see more of those ""hits"" per episode, if this keeps up ... maybe then... And what if they did the reverse with Dara's? Episode 5 he was subpar, episode 6 mediocre at best (apart from the unicorn) ... then John really has a chance at it ... Especially with Sara's being her pure self and not forcing anything. If there are many more tasks where she simply doesn't bother ... John can take both of them on. Yeah yeah I'm well aware it's a lot of ""what ifs"" but ... ... what did John say on the podcast again?"
120,yldx2c_00121,"I am proud of myself for choosing ""inches"" and sticking with it."
121,yldx2c_00122,"Would you have been allowed to press the Emergency Stop button on the travellator? I don't like tasks that go over the top on difficuly; Series 9 had many and I felt it suffered. I'm not saying an all-fail task is inherently bad - the ones in Series 10 were because the contestants were comically bad at it. But this one had too many traps - especially the hidden stepping stones. Here are the conditions I'd do: You can only step on stepping stones, but don't have to step on ALL of them You can put your hands wherever you want, but the paint bowl must stay on your head. Also, you cannot use your clothes or body as an intermediary step between transferring paint from the bowl to the bullseye. Wise decision to put aa time limit on the microwave task. I wonder, if a contestant stalled until the last minute, would Alex say ""I would open the task now""?"
122,yldx2c_00123,"much as there's lots to like about this series, especially with how much I was looking forward to Dara, Fern and Sarah, I can't deny they don't even come close (not yet, anyway) to the overall cohesion of the cast that's happened in the last two series. especially the Morgana cast. then again, this is a very special element that's only happened a handful of times in TM history. and this isn't even really a criticism so much as just observation of a difference. You don't need that cast tightness to still have a great run"
123,yldx2c_00124,Now we find out which of them are true Taskmaster fans.
124,yldx2c_00125,I concur with Alex about Rufus Wainwright
125,yldx2c_00126,"So why are they not updating series scores, Drama?"
126,yldx2c_00127,"I'd be curious if they had to walk the moving part first, I was waiting for someone to just stop the machine after their first walk on the normal side"
127,yldx2c_00128,I thought the lobster looked more like a potato that was growing eyes.... where as Johns I could almost see a pony if you squint and tilt your head.
128,yldx2c_00129,"I genuinely don't know who might be the least sane between John, Fern and Munya but I feel like it may be Munya as he has zero shame."
129,yldx2c_00130,The milk bottle task from NZ!
130,yldx2c_00131,Taskmaster NZ is unmatched
131,yldx2c_00132,"""I wouldn't open it yet"" is 100% a trap"
132,yldx2c_00133,I’m hoping for some to do a David Correos
133,yldx2c_00134,"Oh, it's slightly different from the NZ task"
134,yldx2c_00135,Oh Dara.
135,yldx2c_00136,"If you don't know, munya is ripped"
136,yldx2c_00137,John I’m crying
137,yldx2c_00138,"Great episode, I've really enjoyed this!"
138,yldx2c_00139,Thoroughly enjoyed that episode
139,yldx2c_00140,"The flags were lower for John than Sarah on the paint task, she had the flags on top of 2 tyres, his was only 1. Outrageous! #JusticeForJohn"
140,yldx2c_00141,Sarah always looks surprised to hear her voice
141,yldx2c_00142,oh so its slightly different than new zeeland
142,yldx2c_00143,Dara’s face suggests that he has a big regret.
143,yldx2c_00144,Sarah's a genius
144,yldx2c_00145,ARREE YOOOOOOOU REEEAADAAAAAAY?!?
145,yldx2c_00146,I CAN RELATE TO JOHN'S SO MUCH
146,yldx2c_00147,OH GOSH I had those Dennis The Menace badges! 5 points from me to Kearnsey
147,yldx2c_00148,So make John regret things for you?
148,yldx2c_00149,Oh that close up on Alex then. His eyebrow was fucked.
149,yldx2c_00150,Munya got REKT by Sarah and her milk.
150,yldx2c_00151,Style points through the roof.
151,yldx2c_00152,Oh wait what no
152,yldx2c_00153,"Wait, what? I love it. Lol"
153,yldx2c_00154,Ghost Knitting Club should be a band name
154,yldx2c_00155,That's actually a very unshocking Google result.
155,yldx2c_00156,Dara using the big brain there.
156,yldx2c_00157,What song was played during the live task?
157,yldx2c_00158,Has channel 4 had a rebrand? It was all aesthetically pleasing colours earlier
158,yldx2c_00159,I expected more suck power from the Suckatron 3000...
159,yldx2c_00160,Quality prize from John.
160,yldx2c_00161,I was just about to say has he stolen a bloody task
161,yldx2c_00162,I love milky peas
162,yldx2c_00163,I don’t know whether to trust Alex or not!
163,yldx2c_00164,That “Go” from Alex felt almost threatening.
164,yldx2c_00165,This is one of the most ridiculous tasks I have a seen and it's fantastic
165,yldx2c_00166,Dara 😂
166,yldx2c_00167,Oh poor Dara 😭
167,yldx2c_00168,I need to know where Sarah’s shoes are from
168,yldx2c_00169,yay! another airport task!
169,yldx2c_00170,Anyone know where Munya’s shirt is from?
170,yldx2c_00171,New cult?
171,yldx2c_00172,"Ooh, I have a Dennis the Menace Fan Club badge as well. Got it directly from Nigel Parkinson himself at a comic con several years ago"
172,yldx2c_00173,Ooo I share a birthday with Fern. Fun times.
173,yldx2c_00174,Im not sure I like the rule change.
174,yldx2c_00175,What was the NZ task you're all talking about? Lol
175,yldx2c_00176,"Ah, it's lovely Alan-holding-eyes-on-his-chin solo string"
176,yldx2c_00177,as soon as a saw the microwaves and the milk cartons i immediately thought of the taskmaster NZ task in season 2?
177,yldx2c_00178,"What was Sarah's... fear, during the live task?"
178,yldx2c_00179,One thing I really like about watching live is that frantic rush to make a cuppa during the break. Every other series I've watched after (only started watching when covid had started) and had All4+
179,yldx2c_00180,"long legged lobster sounds like a munya quote, everyone hit me with your guesses!! no wrong answers just pure love x"
180,yldx2c_00181,
181,yldx2c_00182,How long would you last before breaking and opening the task?
182,yldx2c_00183,This has to be the task of the Episode Title? Most likely Greg about Dara.
183,yldx2c_00184,Anyone know what the music was during the unicorn drawing studio task?
184,yldx2c_00185,now i just think it’s a sex cult because alex refused to talk about it
185,yldx2c_00186,thanks for the dont google it warning munya
186,yldx2c_00187,Anyone know if this task has been done somewhere else before?
0,yrqyww_00001,John and Munya are not even a team and they still remind me so much of Mark and Nish. The same dynamics of hyping each other's fuck-ups is lovely.
1,yrqyww_00002,The studio tapings really make me wish John and Munya could've been the team of two. I love the way those two interact.
2,yrqyww_00003,They could have taken the bath into the lab right?
3,yrqyww_00004,"The feather task. Fuck me, I thought I would die. 😂🤣"
4,yrqyww_00005,Based on her prize task...is Sarah a Succession fan?? 👀
5,yrqyww_00006,"Hahaha. Kearns was so lucky to get 2 points from that prizetask. That ""Ahoy"" hat may be the single worst item ever put forth. Good God, man!"
6,yrqyww_00007,"I felt Fern's pain on the Bernard/giant balls task, I needed to watch that a couple times myself to get what exactly the objective was (and on a side note, it's long been one of my favorite differences in pronunciation between Americans and the UK is how Brits say ""Bernard"" and where the emphasis is)"
7,yrqyww_00008,"I was convinced that mannequin wasn’t actually called Bernard, and there was going to be a big fat mannequin behind the Gatwick pillar.."
8,yrqyww_00009,John coming through the curtain with the chicken SENT ME
9,yrqyww_00010,"Out of the all-time egregiously incompetent Taskmaster contestents, John Kearns is by far the most competent"
10,yrqyww_00011,THE POWER OF A THOUSAND ANCESTORS followed by a soft hiss might be the best moment of the series so far
11,yrqyww_00012,“But you’re not in a car…” hahahahaha yes John
12,yrqyww_00013,“Maybe try a few more ancestors” hahahahahahahahahaha
13,yrqyww_00014,It's been a hot minute since we've had just a blatant and great cheating fiasco
14,yrqyww_00015,“Do you want earplugs” ‘I can’t hear you’ Is amazingly hillarious
15,yrqyww_00016,Dara pointing at the featherless pillow had me and my partner in stitches
16,yrqyww_00017,Genius to put Dara with these two
17,yrqyww_00018,Sarah miming the milk tipping was brilliant!
18,yrqyww_00019,Mentions of the Knappett will never not bring me joy
19,yrqyww_00020,"Thought John had fucked it, that was incredible."
20,yrqyww_00021,I love it when somebody cheats and gets caught. Lol
21,yrqyww_00022,I love how none of the team of three thought to locate the bathtub first.
22,yrqyww_00023,The System of Endless Plates is a cracking title.
23,yrqyww_00024,the immense chasm between height of arrogance and lack of skill that Munya keeps displaying each week is astounding. 🤣
24,yrqyww_00025,Rewatched the second episode of the season last night and didn’t notice Munya shouts “WHAT’S THAT SMELL?” when he entered the lab. A nice bit of foreshadowing! I don’t think this will be the last time he references that smell in the edit this season.
25,yrqyww_00026,The snooker ball audio is such a cute little touch
26,yrqyww_00027,John somehow absolutely slayed this episode despite all signs pointing to him fucking it up. I genuinely cannot believe he won the balloon popping task with a belt in the caravan.
27,yrqyww_00028,"""Maybe try a few more ancestors"" is an all time great Alex line. Such a solid episode."
28,yrqyww_00029,"Sarah apologising for the milk spillage still, so pure"
29,yrqyww_00030,Omg Gatwick has only just been renovated and fern is smashing the shit out of it!
30,yrqyww_00031,"How was ""power of a thousand ancestors"" not the title lmao"
31,yrqyww_00032,Ed is going to be green with envy if the pipes work.
32,yrqyww_00033,That uninterrupted sequence of the three of them in the garden was incredible
33,yrqyww_00034,24 fucking minutes. TWENTY FOUR.
34,yrqyww_00035,"""Not gonna kick it like last time then?"" ""Power of a thousand ancestors"" Back to back zingers!"
35,yrqyww_00036,Always obsessed with Fern’s studio looks
36,yrqyww_00037,Bernard is actually a security guard at Gatwick. Nothing gets passed Bernard’s Watch.
37,yrqyww_00038,John’s prizes keep sucking and yet always avoid last place because someone always manages to bring in something worse.
38,yrqyww_00039,"Alternate episode titles: ""Personal development."" ""A bit pumpy."" ""Feather Loss Gate."" ""Chief wafter."" ""A pretend man."" ""Papa Spoon Alex."""
39,yrqyww_00040,"It would have been so funny if everyone did frying pan in the living room, so much planning by alex completely negated"
40,yrqyww_00041,Genuinely like watching a Mr Bean episode
41,yrqyww_00042,Hiding the bath is mega sneaky.
42,yrqyww_00043,Is John in 3rd place now? The way he tackles every task like it’s the most painful thing he’s ever had to do and somehow comes out winning or doing better than expected most of the time really speaks to me. I also think he must look delightful driving around in his little sailor cap!
43,yrqyww_00044,Fern and Sarah trying to fuck Gatwick up.
44,yrqyww_00045,Munya needs to go to the Dave Gorman school of cheating. That was way too obvious
45,yrqyww_00046,John and Fern uncontrollably giggling trading plates while Dara does weird silent angry dance moves behind them was pure joy
46,yrqyww_00047,"Me: ""Is Sarah trying to deep throat a recorder?"" Greg: ""yes."" Me: ""thank you Greg."""
47,yrqyww_00048,"Great continuity with Sarah accidentally stinking up the lab and Munya being disgusted by the mystery smell Also John is becoming more and more Paddington Bear each week, bringing in an Ahoy Hat for a long car journey is peak Paddington"
48,yrqyww_00049,I'm so relieved that John nailed that ball task. Running out of time or missing the only shot might have actually broken him. I am here for his redemption arc.
49,yrqyww_00050,The repercussions of the milk task are beginning to rear their heads.
50,yrqyww_00051,The word “mannequin” is now obsolete. From now on it is pretend man.
51,yrqyww_00052,I love when they let us see Alex crack.
52,yrqyww_00053,What happened to Bernard? Katherine Parkinson if I remember correctly
53,yrqyww_00054,I wonder how long they knew beforehand that they had the airport. Must have been great fun wandering around the airport looking for places to do tasks in the planning stage
54,yrqyww_00055,“Power of a thousand ancestors” goes fucking nowhere💀
55,yrqyww_00056,"AFTER THE KICK IT COMMENT TOO, DARA?!"
56,yrqyww_00057,Sarah's realisation of why it smelled so funky in the lab was great.
57,yrqyww_00058,Didn't expect Munya to continue the proud tradition of being balloon-phobic.
58,yrqyww_00059,Oh munya you sneaky exercise ball snake!
59,yrqyww_00060,I never knew I needed Alex wearing Greg’s glasses
60,yrqyww_00061,I seriously hope that Silent Feather Task is put up on YouTube later. That's a contender for Task of the season for me.
61,yrqyww_00062,"This might be my favorite Taskmaster episode ever! I was already howling when John paused to announce his prize task and Greg just went “Ah, here we go” and I didn’t stop laughing for the entire episode. It had absolutely everything! Including some old school Dave Gormanesque cheating! Finally! It’s been so long since someone did such a dirty cheat. Great, great episode!"
62,yrqyww_00063,Munya is such a unique contestant. I love him.
63,yrqyww_00064,"John is not a bad contestant! He was done dirty by the editing of the first two episodes, and you can see Greg salivating at the chance to punish him in the studio. Turns out there wasn't as much of a whiff of the Kumar as we all thought at the start"
64,yrqyww_00065,"I immediately thought ""I want the staple gun!"" And now I'm ridiculously happy with myself 😂"
65,yrqyww_00066,"Not gonna lie, Alex wearing Greg's glasses kind of does it for me."
66,yrqyww_00067,"IDK how they figured out that this particular team task would be enhanced by not letting them talk, but it was amazing. Just how did Munya and Sarah take 24 minutes? It seemed like the team of 3 was the one constantly messing up."
67,yrqyww_00068,The way Sarah cunted that ball into the ceiling was glorious
68,yrqyww_00069,The moment they all realise the feather is missing
69,yrqyww_00070,"After last week, I can’t help but notice Dara saying “what?” in the opening."
70,yrqyww_00071,Just a thought - can they move the bath to the lab's entrance?
71,yrqyww_00072,I love this cast so much
72,yrqyww_00073,"Fern kicking the ball directly into the Gatwick tunnel roof absolutely killed me, perfect slapstick I’d also watch a flat mates comedy with Sarah and Munya obsessively, they are such good foils for each others."
73,yrqyww_00074,“Look at this prick”
74,yrqyww_00075,Is that the ‘pretend man’ ardal used for his hairdressers?
75,yrqyww_00076,Three points😭😭is that a record??
76,yrqyww_00077,I swear to god if someone had checked Bernard for ID they would have found that it wasn't actually Bernard.
77,yrqyww_00078,"I don't think it is legal to murder someone, like when Alex said ""maybe try a few more ancestors"" to Munya"
78,yrqyww_00079,One little thing I've noticed and appreciated this series: John begins every task chucking his jacket aside without any care.
79,yrqyww_00080,Lessons learned from the this episode and CoC2: the system of endless pipes is NOT a winning system.
80,yrqyww_00081,Hope fern gets a win at some point. Boy she doesn't deserve it but she is so fun. Maybe one day she will try to understand the task before doing them. I wonder if we all pegged the contestants archetypes wrong. Fern is actually the nish/katherine/Phil/victoria but she somehow just makes it work far better than the others
81,yrqyww_00082,"I know it would be repetitive, but I would give anything for John to be sabotaging this one too."
82,yrqyww_00083,How is John on course to win 3 episodes
83,yrqyww_00084,The Knappett was definitely set up wonky there. Fern was right to protest! But she got five points in the end so I guess it didn’t matter.
84,yrqyww_00085,We got a sneaky gym ball snake on our hands
85,yrqyww_00086,"Didn’t Dara get the extra plates and thus invent the endless plate system? Also, wasn’t he the last person with the feather and therefore probably the person who lost the feather?"
86,yrqyww_00087,"The prize task felt like, for me, like nobody was allowed to use what they initially wanted. Fern has said that for every prize task her first choice was vetoed by production. Both John and Munya's prize felt like a 3rd or 4th suggestion that was finally able to be cleared. (I did like Fern's She-wee and felt it was very strong, and I actually gave my wife Sarah's escape hammer for her car after we watched an episode of Mythbusters. I honestly don't remember what Dara's was but it almost seems immaterial at this point.)"
87,yrqyww_00088,"Munya finally doing the best in a task, only to be revealed a cheater is made better by the fact that he still would have come dead last!"
88,yrqyww_00089,"I felt Dara's baffled rage when in the studio Fern said ""I remember thinking I'd come up with quite a good system with the system of endless plates"" because clearly it was Dara that thought of both the initial plate system and then bringing in more!! I can't believe no one called her out on that!"
89,yrqyww_00090,May we all find as much joy in our lives as Sarah finds in a leaf blower.
90,yrqyww_00091,John better spend most of his time trying to whip the balloons instead of using the buckle
91,yrqyww_00092,"“You wanting pumped?” is a pick up line in Scotland, can confirm"
92,yrqyww_00093,The dara sass to munya was amazing
93,yrqyww_00094,That Knappet is not up to regulation standards.
0,yy0pcj_00001,Could they have moved the alluring animal before starting the task of putting an alluring tail on it?
1,yy0pcj_00002,"In the team task, they were allowed to talk"
2,yy0pcj_00003,Was johns eurgh referring to the schwa?
3,yy0pcj_00004,
4,yy0pcj_00005,
5,yy0pcj_00006,"This series is so funny. I’m gutted it’s almost over, I’m going to miss this cast so much. Munya and Sarah are amazing together. Sarah laughing like a naughty kid during the create a language task killed me. And the Fern, Dara, John team is utterly amazing. Dara acts like a weary dad having to deal with his two toddlers. The studio banter after the hand task killed me. Dara saying Placedo Domingo told him, then Munya saying those were his dads hands 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
6,yy0pcj_00007,"The Sarah-Munya team might be the best team we've ever seen in Taskmaster. Fully supportive of each other, always coming up with outlandish ideas that somehow work out. I can't not cheer for them <3"
7,yy0pcj_00008,"I loved when it was revealed that Dara gave the wrong instructions he said ""I take back everything I said about John"" when he didn't say anything"
8,yy0pcj_00009,Does anyone know why the episode was called 'the one that bats do' ... watched the episode just now and couldn't find the quote in the episode....
9,yy0pcj_00010,Dara blaming his team-mates only for it to be revealed he'd been the one to cost the team points for a second week in a row is a beautiful morality play in the making.
10,yy0pcj_00011,I've watched every single episode of taskmaster. But I don't think anything has made me laugh as loud immediately as Fern colluding with John about how a tape measure is meant to measure EVERYTHING
11,yy0pcj_00012,"“Who invented right and left, and what's it for?” is the alternative title of the evening"
12,yy0pcj_00013,Fern walks blindfolded the way Bridget Christie walks fully sighted.
13,yy0pcj_00014,the childlike way fearne said a tape measure was made to measure the entire house was so endearing
14,yy0pcj_00015,John casually pointing out the fucking dog's paw absolutely killed me. Funniest bit this entire series for me.
15,yy0pcj_00016,The look on Munya’s face whenever John is trying to explain himself in studio is like a patient and encouraging big brother
16,yy0pcj_00017,"I still don't understand how John won not just one, but TWO episodes."
17,yy0pcj_00018,DARA’S IMMEDIATE CHRIST ALMIGHT AS SOON AS HE WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK AGAIN
18,yy0pcj_00019,"""punch"" is the same vibe as ""do we strike you"""
19,yy0pcj_00020,"""I was shot because I wasn't meant to be gathering cones in the forest..."" Oh, of course!"
20,yy0pcj_00021,“Who invented left and right? And what is it used for?” sounds like Fern was momentarily possessed by Philomena Cunk
21,yy0pcj_00022,The Juxtaposition of Sarah loving everything Munya is saying vs Dara’s frustration with John is exquisite.
22,yy0pcj_00023,The issue with the studio task is the second team up just had to guess shorter or longer? rather than predict the length of the extension
23,yy0pcj_00024,“i was looking for my aunties” DECEASED 💀
24,yy0pcj_00025,“Who invented right and left and what’s it for?” is an all time great taskmaster quote and I’ll fight anyone who disagrees
25,yy0pcj_00026,"""We have to pretend the language works"" I love your brutal honesty Fern. 🤣"
26,yy0pcj_00027,“i’m clearly about to take it as an insult” 💀 dara the dressage horse
27,yy0pcj_00028,"""all the information was on the tape measure"" ahahahha"
28,yy0pcj_00029,FEARNE LOOKED HEARTBROKEN LIKE HENRY BETRAYED HER
29,yy0pcj_00030,"""it's easier to look for your dad's hands than your own"" I just want to know what goes on in John's brain"
30,yy0pcj_00031,I found Fern absolutely adorable this week. “But tape measures are used to measure everything else!” And “Who invented left and right? And what is it used for?” Are personal highlights. This cast is an absolute delight
31,yy0pcj_00032,“Your brain doesn’t work!” harsh from fern 😂
32,yy0pcj_00033,my american friend just got to johns costume and said “does fancy dress not mean you dress fancy” and i’m deceased
33,yy0pcj_00034,"After the Alien dressed as a Scottish man story, I feel like Fern would be excellent on WILTY"
34,yy0pcj_00035,"The studio banter this episode was even funnier than the tasks themselves, I was dying at them deconstructing John's story about finding his dad's hands"
35,yy0pcj_00036,"Sarah really just a really clever and funny person, ""You could be nice"" just hits in such a good way."
36,yy0pcj_00037,John being cross for hours at the team for moving his stuff is incredible.
37,yy0pcj_00038,“You could still be a nicer person” 😂😂
38,yy0pcj_00039,"Alternate episode titles: ""A punch or a lick."" ""His father's hands."" ""Loads of parsnips."" ""Let's extend."""
39,yy0pcj_00040,munya being in the middle in the series instead of last place feels correct. his confidence makes more sense now
40,yy0pcj_00041,“i insulted lots of the hands but that’s coming from a person who hates their hands” I LOVE HER
41,yy0pcj_00042,"Could sense Alex realised his funny little trick with the Henry hoover backfired a bit, they must have been fuming!"
42,yy0pcj_00043,Things we have learned tonight: Fern is not a furry. John quite possibly is.
43,yy0pcj_00044,They're genuinely in disbelief about the short Henry hahaha
44,yy0pcj_00045,If nobody’s asked… Mods? May I please have a Fern Brady Alien Boy flair?
45,yy0pcj_00046,Sarah's delight at Munya's absurdity always makes me laugh.
46,yy0pcj_00047,"Great episode. The energy of the trio in the group task was SO MUCH like an angry college professor trying to teach sign language to tired toddlers, or confused monkeys. And I love the little pause in the beginning where Dara goes: Ok let's see if they have any ideas, I don't want to be an actively discouraging dad, and then quickly decides: Nope, fuck this, we're doing my way, and then that brilliant backfire when Dara is the one who actually messed it up hahaha John Kearns' Paddington bear energy strikes again in the tail task, not being able to find something HE'S STANDING ON And Sara and Munya have a lovely group dynamic, like a cool aunt and youngster who have little in common and come from completely different social niches, but they're both so mellow and open-minded that they get along really well"
47,yy0pcj_00048,I feel like Dara’s “This is sinister” pun on the hand picture task was under appreciated.
48,yy0pcj_00049,"I thought the hand task was really really brilliant, and I loved the solution with the laser! Altogether with the editing it felt like a proper mystery show! Also I loved Munya's reaction to winning, he looked like a sportsman winning a big championship and he looked like it meant a lot to him."
49,yy0pcj_00050,"Dara got two zero points this episode, while Sarah got five in both and that’s what has destroyed his lead. It can all change so fast!"
0,z3tuhg_00001,"It would be impressive enough to be the weirdest person in *this series*, but Munya might be the weirdest person to ever appear on this show."
1,z3tuhg_00002,That was definitely my favorite episode of the series. And fern deserved that win
2,z3tuhg_00003,Fern!!!! She deserved it so much.
3,z3tuhg_00004,"I kind of think Dara can't really be said to have whistled any more than Fern or John failed to whistle. I wonder if that was discussed? I'm a playwright, and I loved the one minute play task. I mostly agree with Greg's assessments. John was kind of Beckett meets Pinter. I would have loved to see the text of the script superimposed over the bottom of each scene, so we could see what was written. This might have been literally twenty words, or the stage directions could have called out the various actions. Fern's I would say reminds me of Christopher Durang. A little surreal and outsized and funny with a point. Sarah's I'm not familiar of the work of the playwright they brought up, Alan Bennett, though he's obviously had a great career. Very specific and witty, displaying character in the margins, with a good reveal at the end. Dara I would agree with Greg is a bit overwritten, or at least there was a lot of writing and nothing was left for interpretation. Maybe more screenwriting than playwriting. It was pretty good, though. Munya's was just random nonsense. I would love to see what he actually wrote."
4,z3tuhg_00005,"Does anyone else wonder if the podcast mistake last week, that Ed talks about in this week's episode, was a spoiler for the winner?"
5,z3tuhg_00006,"Apart from the ""pop 99 balloons"" task the painting task in this episode was the first one Sarah did lose and only got 1 point. Also, her lowest overall score for an entire episode was 15 in episode 7. Haven't checked it yet, but I think this is the ""highest lowest score"" for any contestant ever. Probably even for the international versions as well."
6,z3tuhg_00007,Johns managed to annoy Dara even on an ndividual task.
7,z3tuhg_00008,“what does the green represent” “those are the irish mountains” omg
8,z3tuhg_00009,fearne’s impression of sarah is equally good and shit at the same time
9,z3tuhg_00010,munya is the judi love of this series. the bullshit he spews is astounding
10,z3tuhg_00011,"Was lucky to be able to go to the live record for this one. Some things I remember from the studio: Pre show: Alex said 'John I think you're the first person on the show to wear a fleece. Not a judgement just an observation', which got a laugh from everyone. John said that on the first day they were asked to bring in 12 outfits, 10 for the shoots and 2 spares and he really was running out of clothes. Prize task: They talked for a long time about the wheelbarrow of pennies. John pretended to be Greg's bank manager ringing him up to let him know his taskmaster pay would be 1p short, expecting Greg not to care, but he said he cared a lot. I remember Greg also remarked that John's face looked really dry around the mouth, to which John got defensive and said its not fair the girls get makeup for TV but not the guys - and then the other guys revealed they'd all been given makeup. Fern said of course Greg would need some, and he slated her for her comment When fern brought in her bottle opener, Alex showed that his ring could be used to open bottles. During the live task, he demonstrated it as they set it up and spilled beer everywhere. Art Task : When Fern revealed her picture on the toilet seat, everyone was amazed and she spoke about art was the only thing she was OK at and that her GCSE art project got used as the example picture for all of Scotland. Then she said that her art teacher used to fondle her breasts and her dad made her bring in a brick in her schoolbag in case he tried it again, as anything hidden in a bag is 'fair game'. She demonstrated the fondling on John and he said 'Oh god, I haven't got breasts have I? Between this and the dry skin this episode is terrible for my self esteem. When Sarah said she brought toilet paper everywhere anyway, Greg asked why and she said she's gluten and lactose intolerant, but she just doesn't avoid those foods so goes through reams of TP. The live task went on for ages, John and Sarah spent a good 5 minutes at the end trying to remove their towels. Alex walked over and said they were free to rub against him if it helped, but Sarah said that was very weird. She complained her boobs were in the way and she couldn't reach her towel. John genuinely seemed like he was having a breakdown trying to pull his towel off his head"
11,z3tuhg_00012,"It is She, Fern Brady"
12,z3tuhg_00013,"""I am genuinely worried about John"" we all are Greg . We all are."
13,z3tuhg_00014,John only got 5 for writing because of Dara's performance
14,z3tuhg_00015,"John: “This is easy, there’s no dialogue.” Sara: “There’s no dialogue? You dick!”"
15,z3tuhg_00016,fearne saying she’s so tired in a live task now
16,z3tuhg_00017,Love how delighted Dara looked for Fern!
17,z3tuhg_00018,“me glasses were on the outside of me ping pong balls” “to be honest it’s something i’d avoid at edinburgh fringe” “are you happy with it?!?!” SARAH IM CRYING
18,z3tuhg_00019,“is there a chance you killed someone’s dog” 💀
19,z3tuhg_00020,Sarah LOOKED UNDER THE DESK OMG QUEEN
20,z3tuhg_00021,Most dramatic black-and-white scene ever made not to feature Bob Odenkirk
21,z3tuhg_00022,"God I'm so happy for Fern. Also, absolutely fantastic episode. This series has been incredible - I really underestimated it when the contestants was announced too"
22,z3tuhg_00023,"This was the best episode for Fern to win. Her play was very good, her performance as Sarah was brilliant, her self-portrait was great. Well done Fern. Edit: Completely forgot, the prize task was also great. I've been to a few parties where it was hard to find a bottle opener, and the person who had one as a key fob always ends up being in high demand."
23,z3tuhg_00024,"""Any of you ever heard of the Norfolk Panther?"" ""Widely discredited. Go on."""
24,z3tuhg_00025,Having them do eachothers plays is such a good idea
25,z3tuhg_00026,Absolutely love that they left a blank task under Sarah’s desk
26,z3tuhg_00027,"That play task I think is the most definitive proof that even if apparently people have asked for a non-celeb version of Taskmaster, it's at its absolute best when done by entertainment professionals. Their performances were mindblowing!"
27,z3tuhg_00028,"Throughout Taskmaster history there have been many decisions I disagree with, but John getting 5 points for his script is by far the most insane decision to me."
28,z3tuhg_00029,Oh my god the subtitles. “Lusty snort.” “Limp raspberry.”
29,z3tuhg_00030,DARA instead of NASA was a great touch
30,z3tuhg_00031,Thank god Fern gets to keep her bottle opener
31,z3tuhg_00032,Dara O’Briain could have done The Godfather but Al Pacino could never do Door(s)
32,z3tuhg_00033,"""I can have a cloth to clean my sausage"" Gahahahahaha."
33,z3tuhg_00034,"Oh my god, Sarah Millican and Fern Brady putting on an Alan Bennet Talking Heads monologue parody is 100% top notch, absolutely amazing."
34,z3tuhg_00035,That one-person play task is absolutely one of the best things Alex has ever come up with
35,z3tuhg_00036,Just from Fern I understand why they couldn't just have this as a tiebreaker. This is going to be an instant classic isn't it?
36,z3tuhg_00037,John bounces from incredibly inept to absolute genius completely at random
37,z3tuhg_00038,Happy for Fern - well-deserved. John trying to squeeze his own head off in the live was brilliant though!
38,z3tuhg_00039,I've never been more anxious during the final task. I was ready to riot if someone stole Fern's win from under her lol
39,z3tuhg_00040,"Fern's toilet seat painting genuinely prompted an audible ""wow!"""
40,z3tuhg_00041,I'm extremely happy Fern finally won an episode. Dara look like a happy proud father seeing his 'daughter' won.
41,z3tuhg_00042,"""It's the sort of thing I'd avoid at the end of a Fringe"" is by far the most brutal thing I've ever heard Sarah say. She hated that play. Honestly, it might be the most devastating remark one contestant's ever said to another."
42,z3tuhg_00043,""" Those are the Irish mountains"" 😂"
43,z3tuhg_00044,Could Fern be any more of an absolute delight? Her cracking up at herself has become my favourite part of this series. She is amazing. Also her being amazed when she does well. And thanks to her I now assume all Greg eats is roasts. So happy she won the episode!!
44,z3tuhg_00045,"Is the snort, raspberry, whistle task the first that has ever been acknowledged on the show to be a tie-break task? I know tie-breaks have been promoted before, like the lasso Alex task, but I don't recall it ever being acknowledged on the show."
45,z3tuhg_00046,"This is easily shaping up to be one of the best episodes of TM. The play task is an all timer, the other two are properly solid as well."
46,z3tuhg_00047,Giving John and Dara each other plays is fucking genius. 🤣
47,z3tuhg_00048,“What’s the business end of a sausage”
48,z3tuhg_00049,John's American accent sounds like Charlie Day lmao
49,z3tuhg_00050,Can someone please explain Greg’s logic in giving John’s eight words 5 points?! Dara made it good but it was a terrible play. Is it just that he doesn’t want John falling behind massively at this stage?
50,z3tuhg_00051,Not me crying because Fern won the episode when the prize task was underestimated items. Genuinely so happy for her.
51,z3tuhg_00052,I don't normally give a shit about the scores but I think Dara's script should have scored higher than John's
52,z3tuhg_00053,I feel that one from Fern. I feel that with my whole heart.
53,z3tuhg_00054,Dara's interpretation of John's play is giving me Ingmar Bergman vibes
54,z3tuhg_00055,I'm so happy that Fern won an episode
55,z3tuhg_00056,Holy shit. Fern'a drawing is better than most TM participants drawings. And she used the business end of a sausage. And that play task is excellent. I think it's a logistical nightmare for them. But I love these kind of tasks where it involves a participant doing something for another.
56,z3tuhg_00057,FEARNE HAS ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED THIS CHALLENGE.
57,z3tuhg_00058,"I felt so bad for Sarah in the play performance. Like...how could you ever elevate that to a win? As much as I liked the concept of the pair of tasks, I knew it was gonna result in some fucky scoring. Side note, Fern's bottle opener made me flash back to college hard. I went to a specialty college for a bit where literally 80% of my program smoked, so I ended up carrying a lighter just to be helpful to those around me since people always asked for a light (as I don't smoke myself). I could have never foreseen the benefit that decision made to my sex life, including guys who were massively out of my league that I would have never approached. Good times!"
58,z3tuhg_00059,“how many words have you wrote” “that’s not important” 💀
59,z3tuhg_00060,"Every time I see a wheelie bin, I think this is the task where Alex got injured"
60,z3tuhg_00061,it 💯 does look like chris whitty 😂
61,z3tuhg_00062,"I don’t think I have laughed so hard over Taskmaster then when Fern was in tears over that snort, raspberry, whistle task. I felt like I was experiencing everything alone with her. But also oh gosh I screamed so hard at Sarah with freaking ping pong ball eyes!"
62,z3tuhg_00063,"They’ve saved The Grape Escape for the Final! I’m guessing this means that it produced some good laughs. What a wonderful series. Fern has made all these episodes such a delight, a true original. Everyone else has been great in their own rights. This was a triumph of casting all around."
63,z3tuhg_00064,"Fern wins off some absolutely stellar work, Dara gets a slight cushion to his lead but the trophy race is still competitive, and we got plenty of laughs. Not much more you can ask for in an episode."
64,z3tuhg_00065,fearne pissing herself at herself is so pure
65,z3tuhg_00066,That was genuinely one of the best episodes of Taskmaster
66,z3tuhg_00067,Whoever's writing these subtitles must have so much fun doing it. Raspberry-cum-Snort Laugh adjacent snort
67,z3tuhg_00068,"I had a feeling they were going to mix each others’ plays. I’ve always wanted a task like this. We’ve seen contestants have to use stuff they made, but not so much using things others made."
68,z3tuhg_00069,Given Dara's strength at stretching out a story and John's at meaningful monologues that might actually have been the best combination.
69,z3tuhg_00070,"It's Me Fern Brady. Happy that she won an episode, genuinely thought she had fucked it in the stage task. I thought the script writing was incredibly harsh, John wrote 8 words yet got 5 points because Dara made magic out of it but Dara only got 4 despite it being highly praised to begin with? Very harsh imo. Should've been a full 10 for Dara and John should've gotten two (because it was still better than Munyas) Ferns being 5 was generous too but it won her the episode so I don't mind so much. Great acting from her though."
70,z3tuhg_00071,Dara elevated that piece of shit massively
71,z3tuhg_00072,"Love how everyone's up in arms about the John screenwriting scoring being too high when John has been getting absolutely shafted this whole series, sometimes really unfairly. Like, it's literally not even effecting the scoring of the others, since he's joint first with 2 other people! Let the man have this win."
72,z3tuhg_00073,Alternative titles: Too dry to snort. The audience walk in. Man. An otherworldly experience. The mountains of Ireland. 50 sausages for 15p. Old bloated bin body. I feel like a horse.
73,z3tuhg_00074,"Dara looking genuinely concerned over Fern and her Social Life Support Aid Bottle-Opener was a moment, poor Fern."
74,z3tuhg_00075,"That was quite the laugh by one person for Sarah’s gsm comment - a stationer in the audience, perhaps?"
75,z3tuhg_00076,What toy store from hell did they get all these stuffed cats from??
76,z3tuhg_00077,Of course Dara’s one is about space travel
77,z3tuhg_00078,dara actually put in work for this omg
78,z3tuhg_00079,That's amazing from Fern.
79,z3tuhg_00080,I’d like a video of Dara doing the play without the audience laughter.
80,z3tuhg_00081,"""Hello Sarah."""
81,z3tuhg_00082,Fern is the most precious thing.
82,z3tuhg_00083,"I'd love to see the play task again in the future, but see if they can get in a properly famous actor to act them out. Wonder if they could wrangle David Tennant for a day."
83,z3tuhg_00084,Think I'm calling it - that's the best episode ever IMO.
84,z3tuhg_00085,MAN
85,z3tuhg_00086,Fern's painting is absolutely incredible
86,z3tuhg_00087,I think that means: Dara 164 Sarah 159 Fern 136 Munya 134 John 132
87,z3tuhg_00088,Absolutely thrilled. Glad to see Fern able to sneak over the line at the end. I actually think Dara wanted to help her in the live task.
88,z3tuhg_00089,I would like to personally praise the subtitles for the snort-raspberry-whistle task. Made an already funny task even better
89,z3tuhg_00090,"Really fun set of tasks this episode. Snort, raspberry, whistle was plain silly (I could see why it was intended as a tie-breaker). Writing and performing each other's plays was comedy gold. The toilet materials self-portrait yielded so many surprising results. Even the towel studio task managed to have me at the edge of my seat (and John almost hung himself). Sarah's hidden troll task was also really fun. I like that they're now anticipating the contestants looking under the table. Genuinely glad for Fern's win, although you kind of feel like Greg was pushing it a little in her favor, but she definitely earned it in the nick of time. I feel like John was cracking up more than usual throughout this episode, especially during the 1-minute plays task. I finally realized who he reminds me of: Zach Galifianakis. Can't believe we're coming to the end of another series. These weeks fly by way too quickly and I'm not ready to say goodbye."
90,z3tuhg_00091,"""My one minute play was much better than this!"" {Cut to an exasperated John Kearns.}"
91,z3tuhg_00092,Every episode just makes me heart eyes at Fern even more. She's amazingly sweet and funny. I adore her.
92,z3tuhg_00093,"Let's be honest, how many of you have tried snort-raspberry-whistling now? 🤣 I spent the walk to my kids school trying it quietly and giggling remembering the contestants attempts. Particularly Fern's cry-laughing at herself, John's desperate attempts to whistle, and Munya's pervert whistle. 🤣 What a corker of a task."
93,z3tuhg_00094,"I dont know what it says about the sophistication level of us as a species that the ""snort - pppft - whistle"" task was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I've never felt more like an ape, getting riled up by fart noises, and then you start to wonder who you are kidding with philosophy and taxes and academia, when there's so much animalistic joy in someone making fart noises... It's like an dumb existential Instagram caption, no one on their deathbed is going to wish they've worked more, but a lot of people are going to wish they simply made more fart noises and laughed during their lifetime Also, from the creator of PEAS comes the new masterpiece, MAN"
94,z3tuhg_00095,Fern winning an episode is all I needed to consider this a top 3 season for sure. Absolutely incredible casting decisions this year and tasks
95,z3tuhg_00096,Fucking get in Fern!
96,z3tuhg_00097,Shout out to the production team on that play task. They really brought it.
97,z3tuhg_00098,i’m so happy fearne wins at least one episode
98,z3tuhg_00099,Absolutely cry laughing at Fern's noises. I had to pause the television just so I could recover
99,z3tuhg_00100,Geek in me wants to know how they did this with the filming order. Did they ask someone back after filming all their other tasks especially for this one?
100,z3tuhg_00101,Fern's play was wonderfully surreal
101,z3tuhg_00102,The hand bell for break time. memory unlocked
102,z3tuhg_00103,Fern deserves 5 points for the accent alone.
103,z3tuhg_00104,munya what the fuck
104,z3tuhg_00105,‘It is something I would avoid at the Edinburgh fringe…’ same though Sarah (unless shitfaced tbh)
105,z3tuhg_00106,One for the Pokéfans Dara's self portrait looks like a Wooper.
106,z3tuhg_00107,John's prize task is the proof that he's the worst genius of all time.
107,z3tuhg_00108,"this might be the first ""full-length"" series without a tie-break"
108,z3tuhg_00109,"Feels like they’ve played with us a lot more this series than normal and there’s a really clear design to it John being utterly incompetent, we were all wondering if he’d win a task, then a big flip on that. Munya being a confident and potentially capable competitor, which got flipped when they flipped John, to confidence massively overreaching his ability (then the win). Fern, the way it has been built and feels like it’s sucked us all in that we were all wishing her that win. Dara was going to walk this first few episodes, then bad few weeks, now the race has built up again. Sarah being slightly in the background to the others initially, then being built up and the challenge being on. Still feels like most other series Dara and Sarah would have walked it if they hadn’t been competing against each other. They very much lucked out with the dynamics of this series."
109,z3tuhg_00110,"I’ve never gotten such a kick than hearing Fern Brady’s voice coming out of a stuffed cat. I’m also absolutely glad for her to have won finally, I was starting to get very worried she wouldn’t"
110,z3tuhg_00111,"Fern had me in stitches in the Snort, Raspberry, Whistle task"
111,z3tuhg_00112,I honestly would just want a whole show of Fern doing different accents.
112,z3tuhg_00113,"As someone who can't whistle, my first thought was to steal Alex's (like Dara belatedly realised). My sister's suggestion was to record herself and play it back (like Jamali in the metronome task). Loving the play task."
113,z3tuhg_00114,Sarah is fucking fuming aha
114,z3tuhg_00115,John Kearns. Take a fucking bow.
115,z3tuhg_00116,Fern cracking up at herself and everyone else is all I needed today. Absolutely lovely <3
116,z3tuhg_00117,SARAH’S AS GOOD AT A HORN AS JESSICA KNAPPET IS AT THE AIR HORN
117,z3tuhg_00118,Woo-hoo for Fern!
118,z3tuhg_00119,"Alternate episode titles: ""The Power of Silence."" ""A cloth to clean my sausage."" ""I'm so tired."""
119,z3tuhg_00120,As someone who has been ridiculed for not being able to whistle this episode made me feel better about my inability.
120,z3tuhg_00121,"Such a great episode, never expected to get Lynchian vibes from TM. John's play reminded me SO MUCH of this short by David Lynch I'd be surprised if it wasn't his inspiration, there's even a live audience! David Lynch - Rabbits"
121,z3tuhg_00122,"John could've at least tried to sell it as if it was a rare penny/collector's item... he didn't even TRY to sell it that way, like James Acaster and Gandhi's glasses... ""Is there a chance that you killed someone's dog?"" - the killer line by Sarah ""Hello Sarah!"" Heh Alex, nice one. I can't whistle either and I'm 30 lmao. Tried to learn on several occasions but it just never happened I LIVE FOR SARAH MILLICAN'S HORN NOISES What did Dara say after the ""Snort Raspberry Whistle"" task and before ""that's irritating""? I couldn't understand him ""It's not been long since he was in assembly, that's what I'm assuming."" Man, Sarah setting Munya on fire both intentionally and unintentionally in this episode hahahaha ""If you sellotape two pingpong balls over your eyes, and then play white noise, you will hallucinate."" Sarah's ""I'm so done with this shit"" stare HAHAHA Fern's voice coming out of a cat is unexplainably hilarious Sarah's play is cute hehehe. And Dara's play is pretty great"
122,z3tuhg_00123,Sarah's horn sounds are just a joyful thing.
123,z3tuhg_00124,“Plinth - definitely not a word”
124,z3tuhg_00125,PLINTH IS DEFINITELY A WORD MUNYA
125,z3tuhg_00126,"John had better get on his knees and thank Dara and the production team for those five points for his ""script""."
126,z3tuhg_00127,What did dara say after the snort raspberry whistle task.
127,z3tuhg_00128,"I should feel bad for John being the series punching bag. And yet... ""I brought in a penny."""
128,z3tuhg_00129,"Fern was robbed there, should’ve got the 5"
129,z3tuhg_00130,"A very long ""ooh nooooo"" there. I fear for her."
130,z3tuhg_00131,"The subtitles during the snort, raspberry, whistle task were absolute gold."
131,z3tuhg_00132,"This has got to be the 8th or 9th time Greg has used the ""This looks like a breakdown"" joke. Like, I would genuinely be interested in seeing a supercut."
132,z3tuhg_00133,"Poor John, his first instinct is to strangle himself and then he consequently has to writhe worse than a madman in an impressionist painting"
133,z3tuhg_00134,Holy crap that Fern painting was amazing! I wonder what she can do with proper materials
134,z3tuhg_00135,It’s the missing “Talking Heads” monologue we didn’t know we needed!
135,z3tuhg_00136,Methinks Dara and John are going to get 5 points in writing and acting respectively. That was great!
136,z3tuhg_00137,Ok but Fern’s tip on the bottle opener is genuinely good advice…
137,z3tuhg_00138,Fern is wearing the same dress that she wore against her roast vs Phil Wang. Link: https://youtu.be/g-H54ERB44g?t=757
138,z3tuhg_00139,I would 100% buy Fern's toilet seat painting.
139,z3tuhg_00140,This is such a beautifully set up task
140,z3tuhg_00141,Happy for Fern but it does annoy me that it felt they telegraphed her victory early on by repeatedly mentioning she hadn't won an episode yet. They did a similar thing with Judy Love last series but that was made funnier/more tragic when she blew it in the live task.
141,z3tuhg_00142,Giving John Kearns 5 points for Dara’s performance? It was 8 words!
142,z3tuhg_00143,If my sums are right a wheelbarrow with £1000 worth of pennies would be about 356 kilos. Even Greg would struggle to wheel that home.
143,z3tuhg_00144,Giving John's script to Dara is brilliant.
144,z3tuhg_00145,"Absolutely brilliant episode, my cheeks hurt from laughing! I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, one of my all time favourite casts! John and Dara in their one man plays were fantastic, the tiebreaker task that made it to a real life task, the paintings, the live task, just bloody brilliant!"
0,z9iml6_00001,Fern had her absolute peak moments here. Her face trying to eat the fake grape...the question of meeting potatoes before...the bird smashing into the caravan...
1,z9iml6_00002,"Didn´t Dara Ó Briain break the rules on the last task?? 3. Put the covered item on the wooden barrel without toucing it with your hands. I was on the edge of my seat till the end of the show, waiting for the final shoe to drop - but it didnt. What did i miss? Do i misunderstand the rule here? Also, show the hidden grapes please (1 on the tail of a dino, but where else?)"
2,z9iml6_00003,"Finally got to watch last night, good finale, good season. ""Did I meet these potatos before?"" is a legendary line. The grape task pretty much confirmed that nobody in this cast apart from John Kearns is that daffy or bad at problem-solving and even John Kearns' performance was no David Correos.... It ended up being much less interesting than the NZ version because they were all reasonably competent, and I was pleased to see Dara correctly guessing that the Grapes of Wrath was a pretty blatant clue. Really great final recorded task, love callback tasks."
3,z9iml6_00004,"I think Greg was actually hurt when Sarah said that he isn't likeable in real life when she brought in her prize task meant for him. As he later said to her, ""well, if you want to be the best you've got to risk maiming people."""
4,z9iml6_00005,Munya did a Naruto run to get the grape.
5,z9iml6_00006,"This series may have had my favorite opening credits of all of them. Fern's ""WAUGH!"" and then Dana clapping the flippers make me laugh every time."
6,z9iml6_00007,"John mournfully walking with the cheeseburger on his head (instead of just carrying it on the plate) with no urgency whatsoever was the highlight for me. Great series, and although Taskmaster always puts together good groups, I really enjoyed this crew."
7,z9iml6_00008,Munya telling John to “put some vim into it” during the balloon task is an underrated comedy moment.
8,z9iml6_00009,Why the fuck would John be the guy who can see?
9,z9iml6_00010,"John said on the podcast that there was a genie in the garage had he rubbed the magic lamp, but it wasn’t mentioned at all in the studio."
10,z9iml6_00011,WHY IS JOHN JUST LOOKING AT IT
11,z9iml6_00012,“Is that sinatra blue?” “Oh shut up” I love their dynamic so much
12,z9iml6_00013,I love that moment between Fern and John! The people’s champs 💛
13,z9iml6_00014,‘Did I meet these potatoes before?’
14,z9iml6_00015,Frank Skinners grape scissors?!
15,z9iml6_00016,"Fern half-hopefully, half-dubiously, wholly cheekily looking at Alex as she debates shoving plastic grapes in her gob is just delightful, I love her so much."
16,z9iml6_00017,"Greg is right, the team of three absolutely have a disadvantage here. One of them is John Kearns."
17,z9iml6_00018,Dara broke the curse!
18,z9iml6_00019,"""The obvious thing was to let the bird fly."" I love Fern"
19,z9iml6_00020,"Dara's the first Seat One winner, and also the highest scoring contestant of all time! What a finale."
20,z9iml6_00021,John using a method Alex hadn't anticipated towards escaping the caravan and then not seeing the grapes is purest undiluted John.
21,z9iml6_00022,"“Fern, do you have green hair?” “What do you mean ‘do I have green hair?’ You’ve been with me all day!” Honestly, I’d probably forget too."
22,z9iml6_00023,Show us the secret grapes ffs.
23,z9iml6_00024,"""I don't even know what an escape room is"" ""It's one of them"" ""...oh, people do that for fun?"" I love Fern"
24,z9iml6_00025,"John staring at the burger and cap for a minute before slowly eating the burger pretty sums up his time on the show. Not the worst contestant, but easily the slowest."
25,z9iml6_00026,"That may have been my favorite prize task in the entire series. Every single item and contestant had me rolling. I'm gonna miss this cast so much, especially Fern! ""Did I meet these potatoes before?"""
26,z9iml6_00027,"I thought the banter in this prize task was the best there ever was. The playing off of one another. The great John line of ""You havent seen mine yet."" And the entire exchange between John and Greg during his own."
27,z9iml6_00028,Bless Dara. he looks genuinely happy.
28,z9iml6_00029,Fern Brady followed by Frankie Boyle: Taskmaster doing everything they can to make sure international audiences finally get to grips with the Scottish dialect.
29,z9iml6_00030,"In theory, John has the items to smash this. Unfortunately he's John."
30,z9iml6_00031,"Fern and John joint 4th by points, joint 1st in my heart"
31,z9iml6_00032,"I also can’t wait to see CoC3… Sarah Kendall, Morgana Robinson, Sophie Duker, Dara O’Briain plus one of: Frankie Boyle Ivo Graham Jenni Eclair Kiell Smith-Bynoe Mae Martin Absolute carnage."
32,z9iml6_00033,"Words can’t express how much I’ll miss John Kearns. Someone said he’s like Paddington Bear, and then he described himself as such in the three items task"
33,z9iml6_00034,Oh John... they needed a whole new tragic music score just for him
34,z9iml6_00035,"It’s great looking back on the comments here later, just hundreds going ‘fuck sake John’ and I’ve no idea which bit they’re referring to"
35,z9iml6_00036,"""The obvious thing was to let the bird fly"" I love Fern's mind so much"
36,z9iml6_00037,It's weird to have someone accept the trophy and not look tiny next to Greg
37,z9iml6_00038,Alex's face when John cut the rope with the locked scissors was beautiful.
38,z9iml6_00039,Watching John Kearns is like watching a Shakespearean tragedy
39,z9iml6_00040,Dara tearing up maybe?? Very sweet. A very very deserved champ!
40,z9iml6_00041,"Regards chick peas: I notice Munya also opened his chick peas, but his can had a ring pull. Which leads me to believe John's had a ring pull, but he has the can upside down, didn't notice, and went and got a can opener from the house (still not noticing the grapes)"
41,z9iml6_00042,Alex having to tell fern not to eat the fake grape ahaha
42,z9iml6_00043,"""wait, did I meet these potatoes before?"" ahahahahahaha"
43,z9iml6_00044,AHHH the little hug and kiss dara gave Sarah has melted my heart a little bit
44,z9iml6_00045,"""I know my scissors landed on top of the caravan. Did every single drop of Dara's pint definitely go over the top of the caravan or was some it maybe on top of the caravan?"" ""... This sort of thing sometimes happens around this stage of the series."""
45,z9iml6_00046,"""I have to say, I think the team of 3 have a disadvantage"" Alex: ""nah"""
46,z9iml6_00047,"I've gone from ""Who is John Kearns"" to ""John Kearns is the best of us""."
47,z9iml6_00048,I'm pleased for Dara. Mostly because he won't feel like John stopped him from winning which may have destroyed him
48,z9iml6_00049,"I'm already feeling withdrawal symptoms, guys. The depression is going to crash hard tonight. Excellent episode for John fans though. His sheepish ""You haven't seen mine yet"" when everyone else is chiming in with their prize-related jokes. I like that they show the very first task at the house and this is where we see John try to hang up his jacket and it falls. I wonder if this was the inception for his ""tossing the jacket before every task"" running gag. Also, John's bewildered ""I'm opening chickpeas..."" when the girls find the hidden grape in the book. Bless Fern, I would've tried eating the plastic grape too. I loved how delighted Sarah was with her big block of chocolate and how she chucked a piece at the end. ""I still got chocolate in my pocket, ha ha!"" The studio task was fun. ""Oh no, he's a Zimbabwean balloon champion!"" And of course, John's terrible attempt to end his reign of failure. Munya: ""Come on, put some vim into it."" John: ""What do you mean, put some vim? I'm letting go of a balloon."" Alex: ""John, this is your last act in Taskmaster."" John (laughs maniacally): ""...fuck it."" *he fucks it up* Good for Dara for winning (did I notice a tearful gleam in his eye?), but I think most of us called it in episode 1. Great series overall, though. Looking forward to the New Year's treat, but I'll miss this insane group of contestants."
49,z9iml6_00050,FRANKIE FUCKING BOYLE
50,z9iml6_00051,No idea how the fuck Frankie Boyle is going to get on with this show
51,z9iml6_00052,“you haven’t seen mine yet” 💀
52,z9iml6_00053,"""Mr Gilbert's grape"" Liking the film reference mixed with the Inbetweeners reference"
53,z9iml6_00054,Surely you go Dara to do the seeing/explaining and get Fern to make it one-handed? Leave John to wave for morale
54,z9iml6_00055,
55,z9iml6_00056,"Fern was robbed in the live task! Greg was sitting cross-legged with Dara's attempt. If he hadn't, Dara would have hit Greg's leg. Conversely, if Greg had been sitting cross legged during Fern's attempt, he wouldn't have been hit. Also, nice reappearance of Frank's grape cutting scissors"
56,z9iml6_00057,MIKE FROM GHOSTS ON TASKMASTER YES!!!!!!
57,z9iml6_00058,Disappointed we didn't get to see the Genie reveal
58,z9iml6_00059,It will forever bug me that they didn't show where the hidden grapes were....
59,z9iml6_00060,This series has been absolutely spectacular from start to finish. I think ‘Have I met these potatoes before’ is my favourite sentence I’ve ever heard. Ever. Each contestant has been so funny. The teams were perfect. I’m going to miss this cast so much. And…..I still have me Fern Brady stuck in my head.
60,z9iml6_00061,One thing I am glad about the series being over is not having to see that snow swimmer for a while
61,z9iml6_00062,Fern's balloon didn't hit Greg and I will DIE on that hill!
62,z9iml6_00063,"-Fern looks incredible in the studio -Greg I also can't get Me Fern Brady out of my head -Big Manatee in a suit or something -My best friend if all my friends perished in a maritime disaster And that's just like the first three minutes, I'll stop or I'll just transcribe the whole episode"
63,z9iml6_00064,“Nice Rented Person”… just bring in Fred the Swede
64,z9iml6_00065,Why would they put John as the director?
65,z9iml6_00066,Oh man that banter in the prize task round where they all jumped in... The chemistry has really been there this series
66,z9iml6_00067,"Dara looks so genuinely happy, my heart!"
67,z9iml6_00068,"John's jacket bit is true performance art, I hope someone does a supercut"
68,z9iml6_00069,Dara now has the highest point total in Taskmaster. Wow! Liza has been dethroned
69,z9iml6_00070,"NZ Eat the Grape >>> UK Eat the grape but great try nonetheless, I enjoyed Fern's face as she was trying to eat fake grapes"
70,z9iml6_00071,Also confirmation on TM socials that we're getting the series 15 cast straight afterwards.
71,z9iml6_00072,I don’t think Alex expected anyone to cut the string without unlocking the scissors.
72,z9iml6_00073,Why does dara look like he's about to cry?
73,z9iml6_00074,"This episode started off at 100mph with Sarah’s prize task submission and did not let up once, lol. I will miss Fern the most but this has really been an incredible series."
74,z9iml6_00075,The first seat curse has been lifted!
75,z9iml6_00076,Sarah saying that Greg lacked likability actually made me gasp-laugh. She was playing with fire on that one!
76,z9iml6_00077,"I hope that in future seasons someone finds shriveled grapes hidden in the caravan. I believe that in one of the podcasts they revealed that they had a genie actor ready to appear in case John rubbed his magic lamp. Alas, he did not. Other books in the bookcase should have been What's Eating Gilbert Grape and A Raisin in the Sun. John was easily the worst choice to be the eyes of the team task. Fern would have been the best. Dara would have been the angriest."
77,z9iml6_00078,That grape scissor has got to be a shoutout to Frank’s first Taskmaster prize task ever
78,z9iml6_00079,"Brilliant gang this series, first one in a while that made me want to check out every contestant's solo stuff. Well done Dara!"
79,z9iml6_00080,"At first Dara seemed genuinely a bit emotional when receiving the prize, how sweet."
80,z9iml6_00081,"Omg John's face when he said ""fuck it"" and let go of the balloons! I'm simultaneously terrified and dying laughing."
81,z9iml6_00082,"I was genuinely getting up to take a poo when Greg joked that they had to go to an ad break because “look at him, he needs to take a poo” and it was eerie"
82,z9iml6_00083,Is this the prize task or Channel 4 Comedy Roast of Greg Davies?
83,z9iml6_00084,"MANATEE IN A SUIT ""What you don't have that I do have is likeability."" SARAH SETTING GREG ON FIRE, something makes me feel like she intentionally waited until the last episode to pull a Rhod (but plz no Sarah I want you to win this season...!) Sarah AND Fern?! HAHAHA Oh Munya... Oh my god them all riffing off Dara's prize was brilliant ""John Kearns sort of wins..."" LMAO Another NZ-inspired task!!!! ""WAIT, DID I MEET THESE POTATOES BEFORE?!"" OH FERN, NEVER CHANGE Fernally, it's Fine! I'm done with the S14 Points behind Leader graph; I'll be posting it like 8 hours or so after the spoiler ban!"
84,z9iml6_00085,"Very glad to see Dara win, much as I love Sarah. The people who are known to be very clever academically usually do terribly (VCM, Nish, Paul Sinha, Hugh Dennis) and as a scientist it's good to see a fellow nerd actually win. Also, not very scientific but, he broke the chair 1 curse!"
85,z9iml6_00086,Correct me if I’m wrong but is Dara the first contestant in the first chair to win a series?
86,z9iml6_00087,How on earth have they convinced Channel 4 to let them get Frankie Boyle
87,z9iml6_00088,"I was actually a little disappointed in the Grape Escape, it was a bit too easy! Yes, we got John's debacle out of it, but being able to shortcut it THAT hard kinda robbed the fun out of the last few contestants (and they didn't even show the other secret grapes!). Great episode though, the prize task had me howling. Also Fern I think hit peak Scottish describing the pens as being covered by the potatoes."
88,z9iml6_00089,I cannot stress how much I’ll miss fern and John
89,z9iml6_00090,Two thoughts after this episode: To my knowledge this is the first regular series that has been won by the person in the first seat I guess we won't get to see footage of the infamous wheelie bin incident after all
90,z9iml6_00091,Grape scissors! What a callback.
91,z9iml6_00092,“It’s like a Lionel Ritchie thing” Fucking hell 😂
92,z9iml6_00093,“Put the other one where eyes go”
93,z9iml6_00094,John... just put it in the hat.
94,z9iml6_00095,BUT WHERE WERE THE OTHER HIDDEN GRAPES???
95,z9iml6_00096,"Very happy Dara won - even though Fern/John completely enchanted me, I think Dara fits into the CoC3 cast better"
96,z9iml6_00097,"Gang, it’s been magnificent. Bosh."
97,z9iml6_00098,He has been a victim of prank! But Ivo Graham will be delight and classy
98,z9iml6_00099,"I was in the front row for that episode, and there was a point where it seemed like one of Dara's balloons were going to fly straight into my face. It didn't, but all the same Greg was right, it was genuinely exhilarating!"
99,z9iml6_00100,Still howling at ‘Have I met these potatoes before’
100,z9iml6_00101,"Listening back to the podcast, Fern asked for a bag of potatoes not loose ones. Surely that would've helped her. Glad to see Dara making it through to COC, he deserved the win. I'm not a fan of overly competitive contestants but Dara was such a good all-rounder and very entertaining"
101,z9iml6_00102,"Aside from everything else - Dara's win, grape scissors, etc - this is one of the few times there can surely be no dispute about the choice of episode title."
102,z9iml6_00103,"So many callbacks in the ""eat the grape"" task! (which is itself from NZ), Frank Skinner's grape scissors, the lunchbox (""eat your exotic sandwich""). I've only seen UK and NZ, so I don't know if there are even more callbacks from the other versions. The minute John's hung up his coat and it immediately dropped, very telling of his fortune throughout the series... Fern trying to eat the fake grape and John eating the burger were so childlike. Alex saying ""no"" to Fern was like a disappointed parent."
103,z9iml6_00104,It looks to me like it didn’t touch him
104,z9iml6_00105,Frankie Boyle... Oh boy that'll be a short pre watershed edit
105,z9iml6_00106,"Oh my god, I’m so happy, could be my favourite series ever!! Little Alex Horne had me in the first half when he said “for the first time ever in Taskmaster history…”"
106,z9iml6_00107,Fern should have gotten more than Sarah in that task cause Sarah didn't actually complete it
107,z9iml6_00108,"John kills me so much, you haven’t seen mine yet was perfect"
108,z9iml6_00109,John finally realising the grapes were right there ahahahha
109,z9iml6_00110,Sarah O'Hanlon
110,z9iml6_00111,So funny that John didn't rub the magic lamp. He is his own worst enemy.
111,z9iml6_00112,Imagine if dara had tried to chuck the man over the caravan haha
112,z9iml6_00113,Go to VAR ref!
113,z9iml6_00114,Justice for Fern
114,z9iml6_00115,"Wait, which one is the taskmaster?"
115,z9iml6_00116,IVO GRAHAM YESSSSS
116,z9iml6_00117,Fucking hell that's a good lineup
117,z9iml6_00118,"Dara, man of science, surely will enjoy Fern's tarot cards."
118,z9iml6_00119,"Talking of the intro Dara on the escalator never made it into the show, which I imagine was because the task didn't come out very well otherwise but it feels like for having a whole Gatwick terminal to play with they didn't feature it much at the end of the series."
119,z9iml6_00120,"As I was watching the prize task and Sarah saying ""what you lack"" but then immidately adding ""in your life"" I was like that's sweet, making sure it's not a personality thing but jus- ""likability"" cold stare Amazing"
120,z9iml6_00121,Fantastic season. Worthy winner. Wonderful cast. Will miss them all.
121,z9iml6_00122,Who makes a better couple; Munya and Sarah or Munya and John?
122,z9iml6_00123,I’m sad we didn’t see the task where Dara comes down an escalator menacingly
123,z9iml6_00124,anyone else expecting them to reveal the hidden grapes?
124,z9iml6_00125,“why are you so annoying” “it’s sorta my job” 💀
125,z9iml6_00126,Did I meet these potatoes before? <3
126,z9iml6_00127,this is WORSE than david correas john. HOW
127,z9iml6_00128,The moment of John kearns spotting the podium of grapes after opening a can of chickpeas... It's why we watch TM
128,z9iml6_00129,Frankie Boyle holy shit!!! I’d imagine the bleeped version is going to be very limited on what they can actually include lol
129,z9iml6_00130,"Frankie Boyle?! Not sure why that’s such a surprise! Ivo Graham will be great, but Greg will ruin him for being so posh. I like Jenny Eclair but cannot see her winning. Early money on Mae Martin - hope she does well at least. Don’t know the fifth one but at this stage assume Alex has nailed the casting."
130,z9iml6_00131,"Wait, was Fern's tarot cards really prophetic? Long balloons = card with contestants with sticks?"
131,z9iml6_00132,"I didn't expect they'll put another NZ task this series (also lol they're laughing at John taking 20+ minutes during the grape task... If only they knew)! This makes me want to rewatch NZ S2 again... Still, this is a great series overall and I will miss this bunch! I have my money on Dara since the cast announcement so I'm glad he won. Let's go S15! KIELLLLLLL 🔥"
132,z9iml6_00133,So happy for Dara. Well earned
133,z9iml6_00134,Dara looked so genuinely happy at the end holding Greg’s head.
134,z9iml6_00135,This feels like a fever dream - my favourite comedian winning my favourite show
135,z9iml6_00136,Episode 1 callback!
136,z9iml6_00137,I think that was the moment that sarah realised that she will lose that series
137,z9iml6_00138,Frankie boyle in series 15 panik!!
138,z9iml6_00139,Sarah would've convinced Greg if she was more likeable Edit: I have just realised how bad this can sound out of context
139,z9iml6_00140,Fern is the people's Champion of this series. Even if she's lost
140,z9iml6_00141,John wearing the same sweater he wore for episode 1 was sweet
141,z9iml6_00142,"Ah I remembered the TM podcast:if John had rubbed his lamp, a genie actor would have appeared, granting him a wish :D ed: I just saw the thread, nvm :("
142,z9iml6_00143,John Kearns just crumbles under pressure and I will miss him so much.
143,z9iml6_00144,“I know you’re going to try to get me wet somehow” - Munya Chawawa
144,z9iml6_00145,FUCKING HELL JOHN 😂😂😂😂😂
145,z9iml6_00146,First seat main series curse finally broken!
146,z9iml6_00147,The first seat curse has surely been broken
147,z9iml6_00148,I wonder how scores would have changed in early series if Greg was as lenient as he is now. No way Sarah gets two points for throwing the scissors on top of the caravan in the early days of Taskmaster.
148,z9iml6_00149,"It wasn't discussed, but did all of Fern's potatoes count as one object, and all of her pens count as another? Or could she have just thrown one potato over the caravan, and/or covered one pen with potatoes? Also, John could have absolutely romped home with this one, and I genuinely worry for him."
149,z9iml6_00150,Excellent season! John might be a loser but he's the real winner in my eyes. John being John was easily the best parts of the season for me. Looking forward to next season :)
150,z9iml6_00151,Oh gang I’m so nervous. I want Dara to win!!
151,z9iml6_00152,"Dara was robbed on the prize task, but those all did deserve 1 Point"
152,z9iml6_00153,A grape scissors callback! Wow.
153,z9iml6_00154,Is that a ladder?? 😂
154,z9iml6_00155,"'I'm opening chickpeas""😂"
155,z9iml6_00156,Need Sarah flicking the Vs as a gif please.
156,z9iml6_00157,"Frankie Boyle and mae Martin are both class gets, not familiar with the others"
157,z9iml6_00158,"Following Greg's logic of finding an empty pint of beer behind the caravan, John should have argued that if someone saw a once-bitten burger on a barrel, they clearly would have said ""someone put a burger on this wooden barrel."""
158,z9iml6_00159,"Everything about this series was perfect. All 5 competitors were ace and there’s not a single task I would skip on a rewatch. (In past rewatches I’ve skipped gross taste-tests or cringe.) I absolutely love how tense the finale was and that the real competition was for last place. John Kearns is my new all-time favorite, beating out James Acaster."
159,z9iml6_00160,"Check out Mr. Three Fridges over here, looking down at us peasants with one measly fridge."
160,z9iml6_00161,"""Too weak?"" Alex is bringing the sass today"
161,z9iml6_00162,That fucking slow walk has killed me 😂
162,z9iml6_00163,"Though I want Dara to win, Sarah is spot on: not all of Dara's cider made it over the caravan, and the cider was explicitly part of the object Dara requested. ""Someone attempted to throw a pint of cider over the caravan"" its just saying ""someone did not successfully throw a pint of cider over the caravan"" in a different way. Edit: also it's pretty much the same situation as with John's burger not being 100% on the barrel."
163,z9iml6_00164,The obvious thing was to let the bird fly - beautiful
164,z9iml6_00165,"FERN! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP PUTTING INEDIBLE THINGS IN YOUR GOB!"
165,z9iml6_00166,Fern is adorable!!
166,z9iml6_00167,A very worthy winner The big head wins
167,z9iml6_00168,He looks so happy
168,z9iml6_00169,"Mae Martin, Frankie Boyle and Ivo Graham have been on my want list for such long time. FANTASTIC"
169,z9iml6_00170,"Dara better just kick the door off its hinges, he’s definitely big enough."
170,z9iml6_00171,Oh John.
171,z9iml6_00172,We're not going to get the Dara on an escalator with a croquet mallet task are we from the titles? 😐
172,z9iml6_00173,The first chair curse is broken!
173,z9iml6_00174,MAE MARTIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
174,z9iml6_00175,"I think that TMUK probably shouldn't take tasks from other versions now. With the exception of the sabotage task, which was great fun, the ones taken from TMNZ felt both over-complicated and much less fun. I had previously thought TMUK was starting to step away from convoluted tasks, but maybe not. And taking tasks from other versions invariably leads to comparing which one was better. I always enjoy the simple tasks more because it feels like the contestants are given more freedom and creativity, which leads to better comedy in my humble onion."
175,z9iml6_00176,Best. Series. Ever.
176,z9iml6_00177,I like how John had his hat burger on a plate and still decided to put it on his head. Would've loved to see the genie they hired though!
177,z9iml6_00178,The synergy of everyone there was amazing
178,z9iml6_00179,Grape scissors are back!!!!
179,z9iml6_00180,"Dara with the most ""Bosh"" approach this season."
180,z9iml6_00181,“Oh shut up”
181,z9iml6_00182,That’s a ridiculously harsh decision on John eating the burger.
182,z9iml6_00183,Surely a small part of John’s burger being missing is the same issue as a small part of Dara’s pint being missing??
183,z9iml6_00184,This is weirdly hypnotic
184,z9iml6_00185,Going to miss these guys. It was a great series.
185,z9iml6_00186,"Absolutely gutted that we won't get any more episodes with this cast but I can't wait to love 5 new people I've previously never heard of next series. I think they may have made Grape Escape too easy, though Dara smashed it regardless. I liked the order 3 things task a lot, though I wonder if Dara should've been penalized for his object being in the man's coat and not touching the barrel. Edit to add: I suppose that would've also penalized Munya, and it's still on top even if not touching, so I get it. Was just wondering while watching if they would nail him. I wish we got to see what task Dara riding down the Gatwick escalator with a walking stick was from. I really enjoyed Sarah and a double Sarah CoC would've been fun but I'm excited to see DOB again. Another great series in the books."

187,z9iml6_00188,Oh John 😂
188,z9iml6_00189,"Hello, is it tasks that you're looking for?"
189,z9iml6_00190,fearne is tired again 💀
190,z9iml6_00191,I’m with Fern. Those pens definitely covered by those potatoes. It never said completely covered.
191,z9iml6_00192,"Fern was a delight and man, Greg got roasted!"
192,z9iml6_00193,Is this the first time they've acknowledged the first and final task? Quite interesting really.
193,z9iml6_00194,"Oh Fern has gone full-on School Leavers Dance in 2002 as her final outfit choice, bless her heart. I think I wore similar earrings and the same shade of turquoise with fluffy feathers attached 20 years ago at my leaving do."
194,z9iml6_00195,Do you think John’s jacket falling was the precursor to him throwing it away every task?
195,z9iml6_00196,Can't wait for the post-credit scene where John is sectioned.
196,z9iml6_00197,"John showed real potential right at the beginning when he told them to stop. Started to explain what he could see and said assertively, “there’s about 20 balls of plasticine. All different colours. There’s…… all different colours”."
197,z9iml6_00198,All Dara has to do is ask his nice man to carry the pint and he's sorted
198,z9iml6_00199,"CLUTCH stuff from Dara, goddam."
199,z9iml6_00200,omg dara wins the series!!!
200,z9iml6_00201,The first first chair winner!!
201,z9iml6_00202,so happy dara won! i love it when a contestant that's a fan of the show wins :D
202,z9iml6_00203,I feel a bit like Fern Brady right now - I'm still wound up from a brilliant final and can't sleep LOL.
203,z9iml6_00204,The live task intro was used for this cast reveal and all that time I thought John was making a dick joke with his balloon
204,z9iml6_00205,"Oh man, I'm really going to miss this cast. The last 4 seasons have been excellent but this might be top 3 of the entire series. Just a great dynamic and chemistry between the group."
205,z9iml6_00206,Sarah woke up and chose violence
206,z9iml6_00207,Some jokes just write themselves
207,z9iml6_00208,THERE WAS A GRAPE IN THE BOOK?
208,z9iml6_00209,john looks DESPONDENT about sarah and fearne finding this grape
209,z9iml6_00210,“and people do that for fun”
210,z9iml6_00211,Team of 3 defo have a harder time with this one
211,z9iml6_00212,"Damn, this might be one of the first times the team of 3 have it worse off."
212,z9iml6_00213,Fern is incredible.
213,z9iml6_00214,Best episode title decision!! Crying!
214,z9iml6_00215,Why did he bite the burger?
215,z9iml6_00216,Fern might be the worst at throwing ever.
216,z9iml6_00217,fern's tired? that's unlike her
217,z9iml6_00218,This has been one of my absolute favorite series. So good.
218,z9iml6_00219,FRANKIE BOYLE
219,z9iml6_00220,Frankie? Holy shit
220,z9iml6_00221,"Holy shit! What a cast for series 15! They’re all amazing, it’s gonna be a long wait!"
221,z9iml6_00222,"Calling it early that I’m probably going to fall in love with Ivo Graham, just like I did this series with John"
222,z9iml6_00223,Now I want to watch Taskmaster NZ S2 again with for all the tasks they borrowed from!
223,z9iml6_00224,"I can't believe that after knowing about Fern for a whole year now, it only just occurred to me when pouring over footage of this finale how much she and Natalie Dormer look alike (seriously, especially some of the side closeup shots during the live task)"
224,z9iml6_00225,"""If you want to be the best you've got to risk maiming people"" is a good quite"
225,z9iml6_00226,Waited a whole day before I watched the episode because I didn't want the series to end. Loved the final task prize and would enjoy a gif of them dancing with balloon hulas if anyone has made one. First chair curse is broken!!! Congratulations Dara!
226,z9iml6_00227,"Coming soon: Taskmaster. I mean, yeah. It’s starting in less than a minute."
227,z9iml6_00228,"Glad I'm not the only one singing ""Me Fern Brady"" in my head"
228,z9iml6_00229,BIG MANATEE IN A SUIT
229,z9iml6_00230,Fern looks so great! And I love John’s bow tie Christmas jumper.
230,z9iml6_00231,sarah: you’re not likeable fearne: you’re old and grey
231,z9iml6_00232,I’ve been loving the tasks this series. This series feels so fresh!
232,z9iml6_00233,I would also like an A4 sized chocolate
233,z9iml6_00234,"That ""but how?"" :D"
234,z9iml6_00235,ffs John.
235,z9iml6_00236,Oh John.
236,z9iml6_00237,Oh no John the grapes are right there
237,z9iml6_00238,Zimbabwe Darts is 100% legal
238,z9iml6_00239,Is that a ladder?
239,z9iml6_00240,Can’t believe there was a grape in the book
240,z9iml6_00241,"Well, that extra grape wasn’t in the NZ version! Very Alex to hide one, though!"
241,z9iml6_00242,If only dara had of found the grape in the book
242,z9iml6_00243,I want to know where the all the other grapes were
